STEVE ROGERS: On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.
LOKI:  "On my way down to coordinate search and rescue."  I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?
THOR: Shut up.
TONY STARK: Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey. Buddy!
TONY STARK: What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.
THOR: Take the stairs.
TONY STARK: Yeah. Stop, stop.
AGENT: Hand over the case, Stark. Hand it over.
PIERCE: Stark?
THOR: Stark? Breathe, breathe.
2023 TONY STARK: Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.
HULK: No stairs!
THOR: Where's Loki? Loki! Loki!
LOKI: I am Loki of Asgard. And I am burdened with glorious purpose.
WOMAN:  ''Who are you? Why have you come to our home?''
LOKI:  I...
LOKI: Never mind. Don't touch that.
HUNTER B-15: Appears to be a standard sequence violation. Branch is growing at a stable rate and slope. Variant identified.
LOKI: I beg your pardon.
HUNTER B-15: On behalf of the Time Variance Authority, I hereby arrest you for crimes against the Sacred Timeline. Hands up.
HUNTER B-15: You're coming with us.
LOKI: I'm sorry. Who's "us"?
HUNTER B-15: Last chance, Variant.
LOKI:  It's been a very long day, and I think I've had my fill of idiots in armored suits telling me what to do, so, if you don't mind, this is actually your last chance. Now get out of my way.
HUNTER B-15: You are now moving at 1/16th speed, but feeling all that pain in real time.
HUNTER B-15: Reset the timeline.
MAN 1: What species?
MAN 2: Variant Skrull.
LOKI: What is this place?
MARTIN: My dad is on the board of Goldman Sachs. One little call and your whole job is privatized. Your little job.
MAN 3: All right.
MARTIN: Your little job, how'd you like that?
MAN 1: Hello, sir.
HUNTER B-15: Come on.
LOKI: You're making a terrible mistake.
MARTIN: You're making a big mistake. Whoa whoa whoa!
CASEY: Hello, ma'am, uh...
HUNTER B-15: Log this as evidence.
CASEY: Oh... Can you at least tell me what it is?
LOKI: It's the Tesseract. Be very careful with it.
CASEY: It sounds dumb.
LOKI: Know this. You cross me, there are deadly consequences.
HUNTER B-15: We'll see.
LOKI: Hey, hey! Absolutely not. This is fine Asgardian leather.
MACHINE: Hold very still.
LOKI:  Now, hang on just a minute.
PAPERWORK CLERK: Please sign to verify this is everything you've ever said.
LOKI: What?
PAPERWORK CLERK: Sign this, too.
LOKI: Oh, this is absurd.
PAPERWORK CLERK: And this.
SCANNER CLERK: Please confirm to your knowledge that you are not a fully robotic being, were born an organic creature, and do in fact possess what many cultures would call a soul.
LOKI: What? "To my knowledge"? Do a lot of people not know if they're robots?
SCANNER CLERK: Thank you for your confirmation. Please move through.
LOKI: What if I was a robot and I didn't know it?
SCANNER CLERK: The machine would melt you from the inside out. Please move along, sir.
LOKI: Okay, I'm not a robot, so I'll be fine.
LOKI: What?
LOKI: Oh, what's that?
SCANNER CLERK: Your temporal aura.
LOKI: What's ''that''?
SCANNER CLERK: Please, through the door.
MINUTEMAN: Take a ticket.
MARTIN: What is this, a deli? No.
MINUTEMAN: Take a ticket.
LOKI: There's only two of us in here.
MINUTEMAN: Take a ticket.
LOKI: This is a mistake! I shouldn't be here!
MISS MINUTES: Hey there! You're probably saying, "This is a mistake. I shouldn't even be here." Welcome to the Time Variance Authority. I'm Miss Minutes, and it's my job to catch you up before you stand trial for your crimes. So let's not waste another minute. Settle in, sharpen your pencils, and check this out.
MISS MINUTES: Long ago, there was a vast multiversal war. Countless unique timelines battled each other for supremacy, nearly resulting in the total destruction of...
MISS MINUTES: ...well, everything. But then, the all-knowing Time-Keepers emerged, bringing peace by reorganizing the multiverse into a single timeline, the Sacred Timeline. Now, the Time-Keepers protect and preserve the proper flow of time for everyone and everything. But sometimes, people like you veer off the path the Time-Keepers created. We call those Variants. Maybe you started an uprising, or were just late for work. Whatever it was, stepping off your path created a nexus event, which, left unchecked, could branch off into madness, leading to another multiversal war.
MISS MINUTES: But, don't worry, to make sure that doesn't happen, the Time-Keepers created the TVA and all its incredible workers.
MISS MINUTES: The TVA has stepped in to fix your mistake and set time back on its predetermined path. Now that your actions have left you without a place on the timeline, you must stand trial for your offenses. So sit tight, and we'll get you in front of a judge in no time. Just make sure you have your ticket, and you'll be seen by the next available attendant. For all time.
ONSCREEN GROUP VOICES: Always.
LOKI: Time-Keepers? The Sacred Timeline? Who actually believes this bunkum?
MINUTEMAN: Ticket, sir?
MARTIN: The guy didn't give me a ticket. I tried to ask for one.
MINUTEMAN: Ticket, sir!
MARTIN: I tried to ask that guy for a ticket!
MINUTEMAN: Sir...
MARTIN: What, you're raising your voice at me, bucket head?
MISS MINUTES: Thanks for visiting the TVA. Don't hesitate to let us know how we're doing.
MINUTEMAN: The hunter and his Minutemen responded to a routine nexus event. It appears that when they arrived, somebody got the jump on 'em.
MOBIUS: You think?
HUNTER U-92: It's him.
MOBIUS: Yeah, stab wounds look consistent with the others. Positioning of the bodies indicates they didn't know what the hell hit 'em. And reset charge is gone.
HUNTER U-92: That's the sixth attack in the last week.
MOBIUS: That we know of.
HUNTER U-92: Hey!
MOBIUS: Wait, stand down! Stand down. It's just a kid. ''I'm sorry... my friend is an imbecile.''
HUNTER U-92: Hey, yo!  ''I speak every language on the timeline too. Jackass.''
MOBIUS:  Tap it.
MOBIUS:  ''Do you know who did this?''
MOBIUS:  Don't worry, that devil's afraid of us. We're gonna take care of him. And we're gonna put you back where you belong.
MOBIUS:  ''That blue... What is that?''
MOBIUS:  Devil bearing gifts. Go ahead and run this for sequence period and any hints of temporal aura.
HUNTER U-92: You know we won't get anything.
MOBIUS: Yeah, just give it a shot.
HUNTER U-92: The branch is nearing red line. We need to go.
MOBIUS: Okay.  ''Go wait outside.''  It's okay.
HUNTER U-92: Set a reset charge.
MAN: Sir, there's something you'll wanna see.
JUDGE RENSLAYER: Next case, please. Laufeyson. Variant L1130, AKA Loki Laufeyson, is charged with sequence violation 7-20-89. How do you plead?
LOKI: Madam, a god doesn't plead. This has been a very enjoyable pantomime, but I'd like to go home now.
JUDGE RENSLAYER: Are you guilty or not guilty, sir?
LOKI:  Guilty of being the God of Mischief? Yes. Guilty of finding all this incredibly tedious? Yes. Guilty of a crime against the Sacred Timeline? Absolutely not, you have the wrong person.
JUDGE RENSLAYER: Oh, really? And who should we have?
LOKI: I suspect, the Avengers. I came into possession of the Tesseract because they traveled through time, no doubt in a last-ditch effort to stave off my ascent to God King.
JUDGE RENSLAYER: That's quite an accusation.
LOKI: Oh, believe me, you can smell the cologne of two Tony Starks. You speak of Time Criminals? It's they you should be after. Perhaps you could provide me with a taskforce and resources, and I could return and eliminate them for you.
JUDGE RENSLAYER: We're not here to talk about the Avengers.
LOKI: Oh, no?
JUDGE RENSLAYER: No. What they did was supposed to happen. You escaping was not.
LOKI: Right. Uh... "Not supposed to happen"? According to whom?
JUDGE RENSLAYER: The Time-Keepers?
LOKI: Oh, the Time-Keepers. Right. Well, perhaps I should speak to these Time-Keepers, gods to gods.
JUDGE RENSLAYER: I'm sorry, but they're quite busy.
LOKI: Oh, they are? What are they doing?
JUDGE RENSLAYER: Dictating the proper flow of time.
LOKI: I see. Right. And then what do you do?
JUDGE RENSLAYER: Dictate the proper flow of time according to their dictations. How do you plead?
LOKI: Guilty... of this.
JUDGE RENSLAYER: What's going on?
LOKI: Hang on. Everyone quiet.
HUNTER B-15:  He's trying to use his powers, ma'am.
LOKI: Don't rush me. Damn it! Why won't it work?
JUDGE RENSLAYER: Magic powers? They're no good in the TVA, Mr. Laufeyson. The court finds you guilty, and I sentence you to be reset. Next case, please!
LOKI: "Reset"? What does that mean? What, is it bad? What does it mean? Hey! You ridiculous bureaucrats will not dictate how my story ends!
JUDGE RENSLAYER: It's not your story, Mr. Laufeyson. It never was.
LOKI: You have no idea what I'm capable of!
MOBIUS: I... I think I might. Have an idea of what he's capable of.
JUDGE RENSLAYER: Approach the bench.
MOBIUS: Hi.
JUDGE RENSLAYER: If you're thinking what I think you are, it's a bad idea.
MOBIUS: Okay, I'm just chasing a hunch.
JUDGE RENSLAYER: Anything goes sideways, it's on you.
MOBIUS: Okay. I feel like I'm always looking up to you. I like it. It's appropriate.
LOKI: And who are you?
LOKI: I'm gonna burn this place to the ground.
MOBIUS: I'll show you where my desk is, you can start there.
MOBIUS: Have a look. Home sweet home.
LOKI: I thought there was no magic here.
MOBIUS: There isn't.
LOKI: That's not real.
MOBIUS: It is, and, unfortunately, so is all the paperwork. Good tinder for your fire, though. Come on.
LOKI: This place is a nightmare.
MOBIUS: That's another department. Now that department I'll help you burn down.
MOBIUS: I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.
LOKI: Are you taking me somewhere to kill me?
MOBIUS: No. That's where you just were. I'm taking you some place to talk.
LOKI: I don't like to talk.
MOBIUS: But you do like to lie, which you just did. Because we both know you love to talk. Talkie-talkie.
LOKI: How long have you been here?
MOBIUS:  I don't know. It's hard to say, time passes differently here in the TVA.
LOKI: What does that mean?
MOBIUS: You'll catch up.
LOKI: So, you're part of the TVA's courageous and dedicated workforce?
MOBIUS: Yes.
LOKI: You were created by the Time-Keepers.
MOBIUS: Yep.
LOKI: To protect the Sacred Timeline.
MOBIUS: Correct.
MOBIUS: Is that funny?
LOKI: The idea that your little club decides the fate of trillions of people across all of existence at the behest of three space lizards, yes, it's funny. It's absurd.
MOBIUS: I thought you didn't like to talk.
MOBIUS: After you.
LOKI: For the record, this really does feel like a killing-me kind of a room.
MOBIUS: Not big on trust, are you?
LOKI: Trust is for children and dogs. There's only one person you can trust.
MOBIUS: Yourself? I like it. Slap it on a T-shirt.
LOKI: If the TVA truly oversees all of time, how have I never heard of you until now?
MOBIUS: 'Cause you've never needed to. You've always lived within your set path.
LOKI: I live within whatever path I choose.
MOBIUS: Sure you do. Okay, come have a seat.
MOBIUS: I told you, time moves differently in the TVA. Come on, sit down. Let's get into this. Go on, have a seat.
MOBIUS: If looks could kill.
LOKI: What do you want from me?
MOBIUS:  Well, let's start with a little cooperation.
LOKI: Not my forte.
MOBIUS: Really? Even when you're wooing someone powerful you intend to betray? Come on.
LOKI: You don't know anything about me.
MOBIUS: Maybe I'd like to learn. I specialize in the pursuit of dangerous Variants.
LOKI: Like myself?
MOBIUS: Mmm... No, particularly dangerous Variants. You're just a little pussycat. I got a set of questions for you. You answer them honestly, and then maybe I can give you something you want. You wanna get out of here, right? Yeah, so we'll start there. Should you return, what are you gonna do?
LOKI: Finish what I started.
MOBIUS: Which is?
LOKI: Claim my throne.
MOBIUS: You wanna be king?
LOKI: I don't want to be, I was born to be.
MOBIUS: I know, but king of what exactly?
LOKI: You wouldn't understand.
MOBIUS: Try me.
LOKI: Midgard.
MOBIUS: AKA Earth. All right. Now you're the king of Midgard, then what? Happily ever after?
LOKI: Asgard, the Nine Realms.
MOBIUS: Space?
LOKI: Space.
MOBIUS: Space is big. That'd be a nice feather in your cap. "Loki, the King of Space."
LOKI: Mock me if you dare.
MOBIUS: No, I'm not. Honestly, I'm actually a fan. Yeah. And I guess I'm wondering why does someone with so much range just wanna rule?
LOKI: I would've made it easy for them.
MOBIUS: People like easy.
LOKI: The first and most oppressive lie ever uttered was the song of freedom.
MOBIUS: How's that one go?
LOKI: For nearly every living thing, choice breeds shame and uncertainty and regret. There's a fork in every road, yet the wrong path always taken.
MOBIUS: Good. Yeah. You said "nearly every living thing," so I'm guessing you don't fall into that category?
LOKI: The Time-Keepers have built quite the circus, and I see the clowns are playing their parts to perfection.
MOBIUS: Big metaphor guy. I love it. Makes you sound super smart.
LOKI: I am smart.
MOBIUS: I know. Okay. Okay.
LOKI:  What is this?
MOBIUS: A sampling of your greatest hits, if I may.
ONSCREEN LOKI: If it's all the same to you... I'll have that drink now.
LOKI: No. And I remember. I was there. Anything else?
MOBIUS: It's funny, for someone born to rule, you sure do lose a lot. You might even say it's in your nature.
LOKI: You know, things didn't turn out so well for the last person who said that to me.
MOBIUS: Oh, yeah, Phil Coulson.
ONSCREEN THOR: No!
MOBIUS: Didn't the Avengers come together to literally avenge him by defeating you?
LOKI: Little solace to a dead man.
MOBIUS: Do you enjoy hurting people? Making them feel small? Making them feel afraid?
LOKI: Your games don't frighten me.
MOBIUS: Making them feel little?
LOKI: I know what I am.
MOBIUS: A murderer?
LOKI: A liberator.
MOBIUS: Of eyeballs, maybe.
MOBIUS: Look at that smile. You are enjoying that. Did you enjoy hurting them?
LOKI: I don't have to play this game. I'm a god.
MOBIUS: Of what, again? Mischief, right?
MOBIUS: Yeah. I don't see anything very mischievous about this.
LOKI: No, I don't suppose you do.
MOBIUS:  Let's talk about your escapes. You're really good at doing awful things, and then just getting away.
LOKI: What can I say? I'm a mischievous scamp.
MOBIUS: This is one of my favorites.
CAPTAIN:  From the flight deck, Captain William A. Scott, Northwest Orient Airlines 305, on schedule to land in Seattle. Flight time today, approximately...
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Bourbon and soda?
ONSCREEN LOKI: Thank you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Absolutely. Is there anything else I can do for you, sir?
ONSCREEN LOKI: I suppose we'll find out, won't we?
ONSCREEN LOKI: Uh, Miss?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Yes, Mr. Cooper?
ONSCREEN LOKI: You might want to take a look at that note.  I have a bomb.
LOKI: I fail to see how this has any relevance or bearing on...
MOBIUS:  No. This is the good part.
ONSCREEN LOKI: See you again someday. Brother, Heimdall, you better be ready.
MOBIUS: I can't believe you were D.B. Cooper. Come on!
LOKI: I was young, and I lost a bet to Thor. Where was the TVA when I was meddling with these affairs of men?
MOBIUS: We were right there with you, just surfing that Sacred Timeline.
LOKI: So that had the Time-Keepers' seal of approval, did it?
MOBIUS: Well, I wouldn't think of it in terms of approval and disapproval. That's sort of a... Let's get back to escapes...
LOKI:
MOBIUS: ...and a little psychobabble. What is it that you think that you're really running from?
LOKI: Enough.
MOBIUS: Back in your cage. See, I can play the heavy keys, too.
LOKI: I was just standing up to make a point.
MOBIUS:  I'm sorry, go ahead.
LOKI: It won't be as meaningful now.
MOBIUS: Okay, well, stay seated.
LOKI: I'll do what I want to do!
MOBIUS: Sure.
LOKI: What exactly is it that you want?
MOBIUS: I want you to be honest about why you do what you do.
LOKI: Liar.
MOBIUS: I'm serious. All I seek is a deeper understanding of the fearsome God of Mischief.
MOBIUS: What makes Loki tick?
LOKI: I know what this place is.
MOBIUS: What is it?
LOKI: It's an illusion. It's a cruel, elaborate trick conjured by the weak to inspire fear. A desperate attempt at control. Now, you all parade about as if you're the divine arbiters of power in the universe.
MOBIUS: We are.
LOKI: You're not. My choices are my own.
MOBIUS: Your choice is your own. Good, let's go with that. I think this one's gonna fire you up.
ONSCREEN LOKI: The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power...
LOKI: Precisely. I was... I am on the verge of acquiring everything I am owed, and when I do, it'll be because I did it. Not because it was supposed to happen. Or because you or the Time Variance Authority, or whatever it is you call yourselves, allowed me to. Honestly, you're pathetic. You're an irrelevance. A detour. A footnote to my ascent.
MOBIUS: You finished? You're gonna start taking things seriously.
MOBIUS: If you hadn't picked up the Tesseract, you would have been taken to a cell on Asgard.
ONSCREEN FRIGGA: Loki.
ONSCREEN LOKI: Hello, Mother. Have I made you proud?
ONSCREEN FRIGGA: Please don't make this worse.
LOKI: What is this? This is nonsense, more tricks. This never even happened.
MOBIUS: Not to you. Not yet. Look, the TVA doesn't just know your whole past, we know your whole life, how it's all meant to be. Think of it as comforting.
LOKI: This is absurd.
ONSCREEN FRIGGA: And am I not your mother?
ONSCREEN LOKI: You're not.
ONSCREEN FRIGGA: Hmm. Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.
MOBIUS: And then the Dark Elves attack the palace, and you think you send them to Thor.
ONSCREEN LOKI: You might wanna take the stairs to the left.
MOBIUS: But instead, you send them...
ONSCREEN FRIGGA: I'll never tell.
LOKI: Where do you have her? Where is she?
MOBIUS: You lead them right to her.
LOKI: I don't believe you. You're lying. It's not true.
MOBIUS: It is true. That's the proper flow of time, and it happens again and again and again because it's supposed to, because it has to.
MOBIUS: The TVA makes sure of it.
LOKI: Where is she?
MOBIUS: Now why don't you tell me, do you enjoy hurting people?
LOKI: I don't believe you.
MOBIUS: Do you enjoy killing?
LOKI: I'll kill you.
MOBIUS: What, like you did your mother?
MOBIUS: Sorry, the Time Twister just loops you, not the furniture. You weren't born to be king, Loki. You were born to cause pain and suffering and death. That's how it is, that's how it was, that's how it will be. All so that others can achieve their best versions of themselves.
LOKI: What is this place?
MOBIUS: Come on.
HUNTER B-15: What are you doing?
MOBIUS: My job. Is it yours to interrupt?
HUNTER B-15: We have a situation.
MOBIUS:  There's always a situation. Don't go anywhere. It was just getting good. Spirited.
HUNTER B-15: Talking to that Variant is a mistake.
MOBIUS: That's your position. I think the opposite.
HUNTER B-15: He should be reset!
MOBIUS: You think everyone should be reset. I'm getting good stuff in there!
HUNTER B-15: We just lost another unit.
MOBIUS: Okay, Loki, I think we can finish up tomorrow and just pick it...
MOBIUS: Mischievous scamp.
HUNTER B-15: Wish I could say I was surprised.
MOBIUS: Yeah, I wish you hadn't interrupted us.
HUNTER B-15: Me? It's my fault?
MOBIUS: Look, he can't have gotten very far.
HUNTER B-15: Split up. Prune on sight.
MOBIUS: No, no pruning, no resetting. He can still help us!
LOKI:  Hey.
CASEY: Hey. I know you.
CASEY: You're that criminal with the blue box.
CASEY:  Ow.
LOKI: What's your name?
CASEY: Casey.
LOKI: Give me the Tesseract, or I'll gut you like a fish, Casey.
CASEY: What's a fish?
CASEY:  What's a fish?
LOKI: How do you not know what a fish is?
CASEY: I've lived my entire life behind a desk.
LOKI: Well, what difference does it make?
CASEY: I wanna know exactly what I'm being threatened with before I comply.
LOKI: Death, Casey. Violent, painful death.
CASEY: Okay, okay. I comply, I comply. I comply. Jeez!
CASEY: Um... Oh.
CASEY: This it?
LOKI: What? Infinity Stones? How... How do you have these?
CASEY: Oh, we actually get a lot of those. Yeah. Some of the guys use them as paperweights. Some of 'em.
LOKI: Is this the greatest power in the universe?
CASEY: Oh, you almost hit me! That is so messed up.
HUNTER B-15: Split up. Check the lower concourse.
CASEY: I do not forgive you.
ONSCREEN ODIN: I love you, my sons. Remember this place. Home.
ONSCREEN THOR: Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.
ONSCREEN THOR: Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.
ONSCREEN LOKI: Maybe not.
ONSCREEN THOR: Thank you. If you were here, I might even give you a hug.
ONSCREEN LOKI: I'm here.
ONSCREEN THANOS: Undying? You should choose your words more carefully.
ONSCREEN LOKI:  You... will never be... a god.
HUNTER B-15: What's so funny?
LOKI: Glorious purpose.
HUNTER B-15: Stop... It. Stop it! St... Stop it... It... Stop it... Stop... I... St... Sto... St...
CASEY: And this guy kept saying he was gonna turn me into a fish, whatever that is, and then they show up and just prune my cart, so there was nothing I could have done.
CASEY: Hey, there you are. You know, that Variant you had got away.
HUNTER B-15:
MOBIUS: Loki? Nowhere left to run.
LOKI: I can't go back, can I? Back to my timeline. I don't enjoy hurting people. I... I don't enjoy it. I do it because I have to, because I've had to.
MOBIUS: Okay, explain that to me.
LOKI: Because it's part of the illusion. It's the cruel, elaborate trick conjured by the weak to inspire fear.
MOBIUS: "A desperate play for control." You do know yourself.
LOKI: A villain.
MOBIUS: That's not how I see it.
MOBIUS: You try to use that?
LOKI: Oh, several times. Even an Infinity Stone is useless here.  The TVA is formidable.
MOBIUS: That's been my experience. Listen, I can't offer you salvation, but maybe I can offer you something better. A fugitive Variant's been killing our Minutemen.
LOKI: And you need the God of Mischief to help you stop him?
MOBIUS: That's right.
LOKI: Why me?
MOBIUS: The Variant we're hunting is... you.
LOKI: I beg your pardon?
MINUTEMAN: Time signature is early third millennium. Definitely anachronistic.
HUNTER U-92: Oil. I think some jackass found himself a time machine, came back here to get rich.
MINUTEMAN: Should we fan out and look for him, sir?
HUNTER U-92: Nah. It's not worth the paperwork. Just prune it. Let's bail. Set a charge.
MINUTEMAN: Wait. Someone's out there.
HUNTER U-92: Check it out.
HUNTER U-92: Get down!
MISS MINUTES: Thanks for visiting the TVA. Don't hesitate to let us know how we're doing.
HUNTER B-15: On behalf of the Time Variance Authority, I hereby arrest you for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.
MISS MINUTES: Long ago, the all-knowing Time-Keepers emerged, creating and organizing the Sacred Timeline. Sometimes, people like you veer off the path. We call those Variants.
RAVONNA: Laufeyson, how do you plead?
MOBIUS: I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.
LOKI: How long have you been here?
MOBIUS: I don't know. It's hard to say, you know, time passes differently here in the TVA.
LOKI: Now, you parade about as if you're the divine arbiters of power in the universe.
LOKI: Infinity Stones?
CASEY: Some of the guys use 'em as paperweights.
LOKI: Is this the greatest power in the universe?
LOKI: I can't go back, can I?
MOBIUS: I can't offer you salvation, but maybe I can offer you something better. A fugitive Variant's been killing our Minutemen.
LOKI: And you need the God of Mischief to help you stop him? Why me?
MOBIUS: The Variant we're hunting is... You.
CHILD: Make a wish.
REN FAIRE WOMAN: Hi! What's going on? You guys aren't dressed right. I... So...
MINUTEMAN: Variant detected, Commander.
HUNTER C-20: Let's move.
REN FAIRE WOMAN: Some of us need this, you know.
MINUTEMAN: No nexus energy yet, ma'am.
HUNTER C-20: It's a trap. Watch your backs!
ANNOUNCER: My lords, my ladies, welcome and thank you for joining us, here at the castle. Please, settle into your seats for a great battle is about to commence. The prize? Our princess. Will evil prevail, or are we holding out for a hero?
MINUTEMAN: Commander?
MUSIC: Where have all the good men gone And where are all the Gods? Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight...
MINUTEMAN: What are you doing?
THE VARIANT / HUNTER C-20: Having some fun.
MUSIC: Isn't there a white knight Upon a fiery steed?
MUSIC: Late at night, I toss and I turn And I dream of what I need I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero Till the end of the night He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
MUSIC: I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero 'Till the morning light He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon And he's gotta be larger than life I need a hero!
MISS MINUTES: Okay, y'all, let's review what we've learned. What happens when a nexus event branches past red line?
LOKI: Very bad things.
MISS MINUTES: Come on, Loki. What is it?
LOKI: It's when the TVA can no longer reset a nexus event. Okay? Boring.
MISS MINUTES: Right. And that would lead to the destruction of the timeline and the collapse of reality as we know it.
LOKI: Can you hear me? Are you a recording? Or are you alive?
MISS MINUTES: Uh, sorta both.
LOKI: Ah.
MISS MINUTES: Watch it! Where's your manners? Oh! Hey! Quit it! That is not nice. Jerk.
LOKI: You can't hide...
MOBIUS: Training goin' well?
LOKI: Yeah.
MOBIUS: Is that my jet ski magazine? Put it down. Gear up. There's been an attack. Let's go.
MOBIUS: Put it on.
MOBIUS: Good. Yeah. Smart.
HUNTER B-15: C-20 and her team went dark shortly after they jumped into the 1985 branch. All signs point to another ambush. We've grabbed enough temporal aura to know it's our Loki Variant. But which kind of Loki, remains unknown.
LOKI: They're the lesser kind, to be clear.
HUNTER B-15:  Let me see the back of that jacket.
LOKI: Very subtle. Well done.
HUNTER B-15: I don't want anybody out there to forget what you are.
LOKI: Oh, your only hope of capturing a murderer?
HUNTER B-15: No. A cosmic mistake.
MOBIUS: That's enough.
LOKI: Lovely.
MOBIUS: Here's the deal. When we get out on the branch, we're not just looking for a Time Criminal. We're looking for a Loki. A variation of this guy.
MOBIUS: A type we should all be very familiar with, because the TVA has pruned a lotta these guys, almost more than any other Variant. And no two are alike. Slight differences in appearances, or not so slight. Different powers, although, powers, generally include shape-shifting, illusion-projection, and my favorite...
LOKI: Duplication-casting.
MOBIUS: Illusion-projection.
LOKI: No, they're two completely different powers actually.
MOBIUS: How?
LOKI: Illusion-projection involves depicting a detailed image from outside oneself, which is perceptible in the external world, whereas duplication-casting entails recreating an exact facsimile of one's own body in its present circumstance, which acts as a true holographic mirror of its molecular structure. But you already knew that.
MOBIUS: Okay, take a breath. Noted. We're gonna break into two teams, including myself and Professor Loki.
MINUTEMAN: Why?
MOBIUS: Because whoever this Variant is, we haven't been able to find him. So let's bring in an expert.
LOKI: That's me.
LOKI: Do I get a weapon?
MOBIUS: Nah.
LOKI: Well, I'll have my magic back. Is no one concerned about that?
MOBIUS: Of what?
LOKI: Me betraying you.
MOBIUS: No.
LOKI: Why not?
MOBIUS: Because you know that we can catch you. And how's betraying us gonna get you any closer to the Time-Keepers?
LOKI: An audience with the Time-Keepers is on the table?
MOBIUS: Keep that focus.
MINUTEMAN: Apex of nexus signature located, ma'am.
LOKI: Let me ask you this, why don't we just travel back to before the attack, when the Variant first arrives?
MOBIUS: Nexus events destabilize the time flow. This branch is still changing and growing, so you gotta show up in real time. Did you watch any of the training videos you were supposed to?
LOKI: Well, as many as I could stand. Your TVA propaganda is exhausting.
MINUTEMAN: And what do these do?
LOKI: Reset charges prune the affected radius of a branched timeline, allowing time to heal all its wounds. Which, by the way, sounds like a nice way of saying "disintegrate everything in its vicinity."
MOBIUS: He's on it.
LOKI: I watched the videos. I mean, some of them.
HUNTER B-15: So he's taking hostages now?
MOBIUS: The Variant's never taken a hostage before.
HUNTER B-15: Maybe he's upping his game.
MINUTEMAN: Or he pruned her.
HUNTER B-15: A Loki couldn't have gotten the jump on C-20.
LOKI: I think you underestimate, actually...
HUNTER B-15: Fan out and search for her. And hurry up because we're at three units until red line.
MINUTEMAN: Let's go. She's right.
MOBIUS: Come on.
LOKI: Wait... If you leave this tent, you'll end up like them.
MOBIUS: What do you see?
LOKI: I see a scheme, and in that scheme, I see myself. We have a saying in Asgard, "Where there are wolf's ears, wolf's teeth are near." It means to be aware of your surroundings. Which is absurd, because my people are, by nature, gullible fools. A trait that I, the God of Mischief, exploited time and time again simply by listening. My teeth were sharp, but my ears even sharper.
HUNTER B-15: We're running out of time, Mobius.
MOBIUS: Hold it. Just give him a chance.
LOKI: You remind me of them. The Time Variance Authority and the gods of Asgard, one and the same. Drunk with power, blinded to the truth. Those you underestimate will devour you. You underestimate me, just as you underestimate this lesser Loki. Which is why, you walk into one wolf's mouth after another.
HUNTER B-15: Two units. He is wasting our time.
MOBIUS: Okay. Come on, Loki, make a long story short.
HUNTER B-15: We need to look for C-20.
LOKI: That's exactly what the Variant wants you to do. It's a trap. He's waiting for you outside this tent.
MINUTEMAN: Should I secure the reset charges?
LOKI: No. He wants me. I'm the key to his plan. He knows that I'm stronger than him.
HUNTER B-15: Almost one unit.
LOKI: And he rightly believes that together we can overthrow and rule the TVA. But that's not what I want. I have a new purpose. I am a servant of the Sacred Timeline. Knowing what I now know about his tactics, I can deliver you the Variant... but I need assurances.
MOBIUS: Yeah?
LOKI: Assurances that I won't be completely disintegrated the moment the job has been done.
MOBIUS: Right...
LOKI: We'll need to speak to the Time-Keepers at once. They're in graver danger than we realized.
MOBIUS: He's lying. Just playing games. There's no one out there.
HUNTER B-15: Reset the timeline.
MOBIUS: You had me for a second. My ears are sharp too.
MOBIUS: Is it just me, or does this office keep getting better and better?
MOBIUS: Where'd you get that one, the snow globe? I love those. I don't remember bringing back that case.
RAVONNA: You're not the only analyst working for me.
MOBIUS: But, would you say, maybe, I'm your favorite one? And why do you get to keep all the trophies from my cases in here? You don't think I'd love having that roller skate there sprucing up my cubicle?
RAVONNA: Because I approve the missions.
MOBIUS: Good point.
RAVONNA: Speaking of which, let's talk about the one you just botched.
RAVONNA: You might need this for our discussion.
MOBIUS: I hope it's a double.
RAVONNA: This Variant is... "Insubordinate, stubborn, unpredictable." Sounds like someone else I know.
MOBIUS: I was just thinking it sounds like someone ''I'' know.
RAVONNA: Mobius?
MOBIUS: What? Those rings were already there.
RAVONNA: And they're all from you.
MOBIUS: Maybe it's from your other favorite analyst. Listen, Ravonna, I'm sorry. I realize that my, you know, methods with this Loki are controversial, but...
RAVONNA: Towing a dangerous Variant into the field is controversial.
MOBIUS: Yeah, it didn't go exactly the way I wanted it to today, but here's what we did find out. The Variant likes to stall for time, and, eventually, we'll catch the other one doing the same thing. Because understanding this Loki helps me get closer to the one we're chasing. Right?
RAVONNA: Look, I know you have a soft spot for broken things.
MOBIUS: I don't think so.
RAVONNA: Yes, you do. But Loki is an evil, lying scourge. That is the part he plays on the Sacred Timeline.
MOBIUS: Maybe he wants to mix it up. Sometimes you get tired of playing the same part. Is that possible? He can change?
RAVONNA: Not unless the Time-Keepers decree it. And then, it shall be so.
MOBIUS: And how are the old Time-Keepers?
RAVONNA: How do you think?
MOBIUS: I don't know. 'Cause I've never met 'em. Thankfully. Although, I shouldn't say that. That one looks...
RAVONNA: The Time-Keepers are monitoring every aspect of this case. I've never seen them so involved. They want that Variant caught.
MOBIUS: So do I.
RAVONNA: And this is the last chance you're gonna get with this Loki.
MOBIUS: Great. That's all I'm gonna need.
MOBIUS: Thank you, R Slayer.
MOBIUS: I don't remember this. This must be from that analyst you keep on the side.
RAVONNA: Stay focused.
MOBIUS: Eyes on the road.
RAVONNA: Mobius?
MOBIUS: I was almost gone.
RAVONNA: You really believe in this Variant?
MOBIUS: Mmm... Luckily, he believes in himself enough for the both of us. And, hey, if it doesn't work, I'll delete him myself. He's really arrogant.
LOKI: You're probably wondering what happened out on the mission. That was your first lesson in catching a Loki. Expect the expected. Half the fun of being a trickster is knowing everyone knows you're a trickster, and then, many of your tricks can come from exploiting the fact that you know that they know...
MOBIUS: Okay. Just shut up! Please. What happened to the guy I met on the elevator? Who didn't like to talk. Remember him? Now I'm stuck with this guy who won't stop yacking away about what makes a Loki tick!
LOKI: What? Isn't that precisely why I'm here?
MOBIUS: No. I don't care what makes you tick. You're here to help me catch the superior version of yourself. That's it!
LOKI: Hang on. I'm not sure "superior" is actually quite the right word.
MOBIUS: See? There it is. Right there. I believed, stupidly, that insecure need for validation would motivate you to find the killer. Not 'cause you care about the TVA mission or bein' a hero, but because you know this Variant is better than you and you can't take it.
LOKI: Very nice. I mean, it is adorable that you think you could possibly manipulate me. I'm ten steps ahead of you. I've been playing a game of my own all along.
MOBIUS: What, charm your way in front of the Time-Keepers, hustle them, and seize control of the TVA? Am I getting warm? A double cross by history's most reliable liar.
LOKI: Okay. Why are you in there sticking your neck out for me?
MOBIUS: I'll give you two options, and you can believe whichever one you want. A, because I see a scared little boy, shivering in the cold. And you kinda feel bad for that ice runt. Or B, I just wanna catch this guy, and I'll tell you whatever I need to tell you.
LOKI: I don't need your sympathy.
MOBIUS: Good, 'cause I'm runnin' out of it.
LOKI: What's this then? The next step of your manipulation...
MOBIUS: No, this is the final step. Your last chance.
LOKI: Oh, and what does my desperate last chance require?
MOBIUS: Work.
LOKI: Work?
MOBIUS: I need you to go over each and every one of the Variant's case files, and then, give me your... How do I put it? Your unique Loki perspective. And who knows? Maybe there's something that we missed.
LOKI: Well, you're idiots. I suspect you probably missed a lot.
MOBIUS: That's why I'm lucky I got ya for a little bit longer. Let me park ya at this desk. And don't be afraid to really lean into this work. Here's a good trick for you. Pretend your life depends on it. I'm gonna get a snack.
LOKI: Oh, my goodness. Don't tell me the Variant ambushed and killed ''another'' team of Minutemen. And stole their reset charge as well.
WOMAN: Shh.
LOKI: Shh.
LOKI: Hi.
LOKI: Hello?
ARCHIVIST: Can I help you?
LOKI: Yes. I'm on some important TVA business. Follow-up to a field mission. You know how it goes. We red lined near the apex, and... Well, it's never good. Um, I'd like all files pertaining to the creation of the TVA, please.
ARCHIVIST: Those are classified.
LOKI: Okay. I'd like all files pertaining to the beginning of time then.
ARCHIVIST: Those are classified.
LOKI: Okay, the end of time.
ARCHIVIST: Those are classified.
LOKI: Okay, what files can I have?
ARCHIVIST: Happy reading.
LOKI: I found something.
MOBIUS: No, I said, "Don't bother me until you've read all the files."
LOKI: I have.
MOBIUS: Every file?
LOKI: Yes.
MOBIUS: Pertaining to the Variant?
LOKI: The answer isn't in the files, it's on the timeline. He's hiding in apocalypses.
MOBIUS: Which apocalypse? Any time in history, there's, like, a million of 'em.
LOKI: Ragnarok. Are you familiar?
MOBIUS: Yes. The destruction of Asgard and most of its people. I'm sorry.
LOKI: Yes, very sad. Anyway, it got me thinking...
MOBIUS: Go ahead.
LOKI: Nexus events happen when someone does something they're not supposed to do, right?
MOBIUS: Well, it's a little more complicated, but, yeah.
LOKI: Great. And then that thing they're not supposed to do, cascades into a whole range of other things that aren't supposed to happen. And so on and so forth, until eventually, a new timeline branches. Yes?
MOBIUS: Chaotic alterations of a predetermined outcome.
LOKI: Exactly.
MOBIUS: Mmm-hmm.
LOKI: So, let's just say...
MOBIUS: What are you doing?
LOKI: ...your salad is Asgard in this scenario.
MOBIUS: No, it's not Asgard, that's my lunch.
LOKI: It's a metaphor. Just hang in there.
MOBIUS: I want that salad.
LOKI: And I could go down to Asgard before Ragnarok causes its complete destruction and I could do anything I wanted. I could, let's say, push the Hulk off the Rainbow Bridge.
LOKI: There he goes.
MOBIUS: The salt's Hulk?
LOKI: And I could also... Set fire to the palace.
MOBIUS: No, just stop. Don't set fire to the palace.
LOKI: Okay? I can do whatever I want to do, and it would never matter. It wouldn't go against the dictates of the timeline because...
LOKI: Excuse me?
MOBIUS: Oh, God!
CASEY: You!
LOKI: Nice to see you. I just need this for a second. Thanks.
LOKI: Because the apocalypse is coming. Ragnarok, Surtur will destroy Asgard no matter what I do.
MOBIUS: No, don't do...
LOKI: There's the apocalypse.
MOBIUS: That's the apocalypse?
LOKI: Ragnarok obliterates the salt. Ragnarok. There it is.
MOBIUS: What am I lookin' at?
LOKI: Okay, it was a clumsy metaphor. But you see what I mean. It doesn't matter. It could be any apocalypse. It could be a tidal wave. It could be a meteor. It could be a volcano, a supernova. If everything and everyone around you is destined for imminent destruction, then nothing that I say or do will matter, because the timeline's not gonna branch. 'Cause it gets destroyed. Hence, the Variant could be hiding in the apocalypse and do whatever he wants, and we wouldn't know!
MOBIUS: Not bad.
LOKI: Take me to a real apocalypse, take me to Ragnarok, I'll show you.
MOBIUS: Yeah. So you can run away back to your homeland? No.
LOKI: No, I'm not going home. We can go anywhere.
MOBIUS: I'm not taking you for a stroll along the promenade, much less an apocalypse.
LOKI: Oh, Mobius, come on! What could possibly go wrong? We gotta properly test this theory.
MOBIUS: Well, here's a fun theory. You lure me out into the field, and then you stab me in the back. And that's a theory I don't wanna test.
LOKI: I'd never stab anyone in the back. That's such a boring form of betrayal.
MOBIUS: Loki, I've studied almost every moment of your entire life. You've literally stabbed people in the back, like, 50 times.
LOKI: Well, I'd never do it again, because it got old.
MOBIUS: Okay.
LOKI: Okay, look, you don't trust me, you can trust one thing. I love to be right.
LOKI:  Here we go.
MOBIUS: Shh, any minute now.
LOKI: Until this entire town is wiped off the face of this planet. Imagine. All that volcanic ash...
MOBIUS: I know. We don't want to get too giddy.
LOKI: Oh, come on! It's cool.
MOBIUS: No, it is cool, but it's just, it's just not in good taste because of...
LOKI: Well they're all gonna die anyway.
MOBIUS: I know. Now listen, I'm gonna watch the TemPad for any variance energy.
LOKI: Okay.
MOBIUS: Okay, because we gotta be careful. If you're wrong, and there's a good chance you are, anything we do can create a huge branch.
LOKI: Oh, Mobius! You make even the end of the world sound boring.
MOBIUS: Listen! Okay, we're not meant to be here. Okay?
LOKI: Okay.
MOBIUS: Anything we do can impact the course of history. Do you get that?
LOKI: Yes. Yes.
MOBIUS: So we're gonna start with very small disturbances.
LOKI: Very small.
MOBIUS: Can you make bird noises?
LOKI: Bird noises?
MOBIUS: Yeah. Bird noises. Like some, like, whooshing noises.
LOKI: Oh.
MOBIUS: Loki! Loki!
LOKI: Go! Be free, my horned-friends, be free! ''My name is Loki. We are agents of the Time Variance Authority. I bring you all dark tidings. All of you! You're all about to die. That volcano is about to erupt! I would know, because I'm from the future.'' We are from the future, right? What is the TVA? I mean, it's from the future. It sounds from the future. It's pretty future-y.
LOKI: Right on cue! Enjoy your last meal while you can! Nothing matters! Nothing has any consequence! Dance while you still can! Whoo-hoo! How'd we do?
MOBIUS: I don't believe it. Zero variance energy. No branching in the timeline.
LOKI: The TVA would never even know we were here. If it were me, this is where I would hide.
MOBIUS: Doomsdays. The Variant's been ambushing our soldiers and hiding out in doomsdays to cover his tracks.
LOKI: You're welcome.
MOBIUS: Yeah. But in order for this theory to hold, the disasters have to be naturally-occurring, sudden, no warning, no survivors.
LOKI: How many of those disasters could there possibly be?
MOBIUS: I don't know. We're gonna find out.
MOBIUS: Hey? Come on, let's take a walk.
LOKI: By the way, at your desk, that magazine?
MOBIUS: Yeah. The one on jet skis?
LOKI: Yes. Why do you have that?
MOBIUS: Because they're awesome.
LOKI:  I suppose they are.
MOBIUS: Yeah. You know, some things... Actually, most things in history are kinda dumb, and everything gets ruined eventually. But in the early 1990s, for a brief, shining moment, there was a beautiful union of form and function, which we call the jet ski, and a reasonable man cannot differ.
LOKI: You ever been on one?
MOBIUS: No... No. I think a TVA agent showing up on a jet ski on the Sacred Timeline, that would create a branch for sure.
LOKI: Oh it'd be fun, though.
MOBIUS: Yeah, it'd be really fun.
LOKI: So, why read about them?
MOBIUS: It just helps remind me of what we're fighting for.
LOKI: I mean, you really believe in all this stuff, don't you?
MOBIUS: I don't get hung up on, "Believe, not believe." I just accept what is.
LOKI: Three magic lizards...
MOBIUS: Time-Keepers.
LOKI: ...created the TVA, and everyone in it...
MOBIUS: Right.
LOKI: ...including you?
MOBIUS: Including me.
LOKI: You see, every time I start to admire your intelligence, you say something like that.
MOBIUS: Okay, who created you, Loki?
LOKI: A Frost Giant of Jotunheim.
MOBIUS: And who raised you?
LOKI: Odin of Asgard.
MOBIUS: Odin, God of the Heavens. Asgard, mystical realm, beyond the stars. Frost Giants. Listen to yourself...
LOKI: It's not the same. It's completely different.
MOBIUS: No no no.
LOKI: It's not the same.
MOBIUS: Actually it's exactly the same thing. Because if you think too hard about where any of us came from, who we truly are, it sounds kinda ridiculous. Existence is chaos. Nothing makes any sense, so we try to make some sense of it. And I'm just lucky that the chaos I emerged into gave me all this... My own glorious purpose.
MOBIUS: 'Cause the TVA is my life. And it's real because I believe it's real.
LOKI: Fair enough. You believe it's real.
MOBIUS: Yeah.
LOKI: So everything is written. Past, present, future. There's no such thing as free will.
MOBIUS: Well, I mean, you know, it's an oversimplification...
LOKI: So, in fact, in a way, you and I here at the TVA, we're the only ones who are actually free.
MOBIUS: Where are you going with this, Loki?
LOKI: How does it all end?
MOBIUS: That's a work in progress.
LOKI: Oh, those lazy Time-Keepers. What are they waiting for?
MOBIUS: ''Au contraire.'' No. Because while we protect what came before, they're toiling away in their chamber, untangling the epilogue from its infinite branches.
LOKI: Ah, I see. So, when they're finished, what happens then?
MOBIUS: So are we. No more nexus events. Just order. And we meet in peace at the end of time. Nice, right?
LOKI: Only order?
MOBIUS: Mmm-hmm.
LOKI: No chaos? It sounds boring.
MOBIUS: I'm sure it does to you.
LOKI: You know, you called me a scared little boy.
MOBIUS: I called you a lotta things.
LOKI: You did. You're wrong, though. You see, I know something children don't.
MOBIUS: What's that?
LOKI: That no one bad is ever truly bad. And no one good is ever truly good.
MOBIUS: Scared little boy.
LOKI: Yes, it was quite patronizing. I thought it was a bit too far, actually.
MOBIUS: You're very clever.
LOKI: I know.
MOBIUS: The Variant left something behind at an old crime scene. A cathedral. A candy box. An obvious anachronism. I gave it to Analysis, but they couldn't find anything real.
LOKI: Why does that matter?
MOBIUS: 'Cause now we have two variables. Apocalyptic natural disasters and... Kablooie.
LOKI: What's that?
MOBIUS: Candy. Do you have candy on Asgard?
LOKI: Yeah. Grapes, nuts.
MOBIUS: No wonder you're so bitter.
MOBIUS: Okay. Kablooie was only sold regionally on Earth from 2047 to 2051. All you gotta do is cross-reference that with every apocalyptic event. I'm gonna give you half. And let's make it a competition, see who finds it.
LOKI: Sure.
MOBIUS: What, you wanna bet something?
LOKI: Yeah.
MOBIUS: Gentleman's bet. Yeah, let's play for pride. Okay. May the best man win. Go.
MOBIUS: Anything?
LOKI: Uh... It's not the climate disaster of 2048. Or the tsunami of 2051.
MOBIUS: Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Come on.
LOKI: 2050. The extinction of the swallow... Is that a thing?
MOBIUS: Completely screwed up the ecosystem.
LOKI: Krakatoa erupted in 2049 as well. No Kablooie.
MOBIUS: God, it's just one damn thing after another, isn't it? Cyclone, famine, volcanoes, floods...
LOKI: Got him.
LOKI: That's where he is.
MOBIUS: Alabama, 2050. You're gonna take my job if I'm not careful.
RAVONNA: You want me to approve deployment of a fully-armed task force to...
MOBIUS: Yeah.
RAVONNA: ...the Variant's ''potential'' hiding spot?
MOBIUS: Haven Hills, Alabama, corporate town owned by Roxxcart until it's wiped out by a hurricane. All the food and supplies you need. If he likes it there, there's no reason he can't keep going back and just camping out, over and over.
RAVONNA: And this is all based on a theory from the Variant who just blew your previous mission?
MOBIUS: Yeah, he's doing great.
RAVONNA: Mobius, as your friend, I have to tell you that trusting this man is not a good idea.
MOBIUS: No no, I know. But maybe he's worth the trouble. He just uncovered a massive hole in our security, right?
RAVONNA: That's what concerns me!
MOBIUS: I can handle him. Trust me. This is where we get our guy.
RAVONNA: You, I trust, but him.
RAVONNA: Listen, Ravonna, every instinct is telling me this is where we nail the Variant. Come on. You don't see me usually this worked up, right? I'm, I'm  excited. I'm chomping at the bit.
RAVONNA: Okay.
MOBIUS: Yes. Okay.
RAVONNA: But, Mobius?
MOBIUS: Yeah?
RAVONNA: There's not much I can do if it doesn't work out.
MOBIUS: For all time.
RAVONNA: Always.
MOBIUS: Okay.
MOBIUS: We're on.
MOBIUS: We are doing some good work today.
LOKI: I thought so too.
MOBIUS: I'm tellin' you. You actually help us catch this Variant, and who knows, my friend.
LOKI: What, good enough for a face-to-face with the Time-Keepers?
MOBIUS: I didn't say that. One step at a time.
LOKI: All right. One step at a time.
MOBIUS: Just in case.
MOBIUS: Yeah, don't those feel...
HUNTER B-15: Absolutely not.
HUNTER B-15: Gather around for a briefing. Roxxcart is a vast superstore common to the era. It consists of a series of sprawling sections, including a large warehouse. This warehouse is being used by civilians as a shelter tryin' to ride out the storm. Remember, this is a class ten apocalypse. While the Variant shouldn't know we're coming, he could be hiding anywhere and should be considered hostile. So stay alert. Every time there is an attack, the Variant steals a reset charge. He's planning something. We just don't know what. So keep an eye out for the missing charges, and if you see a Loki, prune it.
LOKI: The bad Loki, preferably.
MOBIUS: Anything?
HUNTER B-15: Nothing yet. Move out!
HUNTER B-15: The hell was that?
LOKI: That was me using magic to dry my clothes. So I don't announce myself with every squeaky footstep like the rest of you.
HUNTER B-15: Take both teams and sweep the storm shelter.
HUNTER D-90: Yes, ma'am.
MOBIUS: Okay, Loki and I are gonna check out the Green House. We'll meet back at the showroom.
HUNTER B-15: No.
MOBIUS: No?
HUNTER B-15: You go with D-90. He stays with me.
MOBIUS: What are you talking about? He's under my supervision.
HUNTER B-15: This is my field op, Mobius. If he's not a threat, then it won't be a problem.
MOBIUS: Of course he's a threat. Do you not remember the Time Theater?
LOKI: Mobius...
MOBIUS: That's why I want him with me.
HUNTER B-15: You are welcome to go back to the TVA and litigate with Renslayer, but right now...
MOBIUS: We're here. We're not going back. The Variant is here.
LOKI: Mobius, it's fine. It's fine. You can trust me. I understand I have to earn that, so, I will.
MOBIUS: Why is it the people you can't trust are always saying, "Trust me"? Okay, try to hang on to your Time Collar this time.
HUNTER D-90: We'll see you in the showroom.
LOKI: I for one am glad we're getting to spend this time together.
HUNTER B-15: Quiet.
LOKI: I'm saying we got off on the wrong...
HUNTER B-15: Shh.
HUNTER B-15: Hey!
SHOPPER: Whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.
HUNTER B-15: What are you doing?
SHOPPER: Shopping for plants.
LOKI: In this storm?
SHOPPER: It's a hurricane sale. Azaleas are half off.
HUNTER B-15: Could that be you?
LOKI: I mean, I probably would have worn a suit, but... yes, maybe.
LOKI: Is he dead?
THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15: No. They usually survive. So, you're the fool the TVA brought in to hunt me down.
LOKI: Me, I presume.
THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15: Please. If anyone's anyone, you're me.
LOKI: How nice to meet you.
NEWS ANCHOR: For the past hour we have seen winds intensifying. Again, if you're just tuning in...
HUNTER D-90: Check the bags for the reset charges.
ROXXCART EMPLOYEE: You guys FEMA? National Guard?
MINUTEMAN: Could be any one of them.
ROXXCART EMPLOYEE: Well, hey, if you got a 'copter or other transport, now is the time to use it. We got women and kids, and that weather ain't playin'.
MOBIUS: No, I'm sorry. We don't.
ROXXCART EMPLOYEE: Well, how the heck did you get here?
MOBIUS: What are you doing? Hey! These people are scared.
HUNTER D-90: They're about to die. They should be scared.
MOBIUS: Okay. Not of us. Take it easy.
MINUTEMAN: Sir!
MOBIUS: What is it?
HUNTER C-20: It's real. It's real. It's real. It's real. It's real. It's real.
LOKI: Enchantment is a clever trick. Cowardly, a bit amateur-ish, but clever.
THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15: Almost as cowardly as working for the TVA.
LOKI: I'm working for me.
THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15: You really believe that, don't you?
LOKI: Yeah.
THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15: And here I was worried that they'd found a better version of me.
RANDY: Hi, are you guys looking for the disaster shelter?
THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15: No.
THE VARIANT / RANDY: Oh, bless. Are you going to call your little friends for help?
LOKI: What's the matter? You too scared to meet me face-to-face? Show yourself. You know, gaining their confidence was no mean feat.
THE VARIANT / RANDY: Oh, my God. You went undercover.
LOKI: If you could possibly sheathe your smarm for a moment, I have an offer for you. That's why I found you.
THE VARIANT / RANDY: Go on.
LOKI: I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers. And, uh, cards on the table, I could use a qualified lieutenant.
THE VARIANT / RANDY: And I assume you mean... Me?
LOKI: What say you... Loki?
THE VARIANT / RANDY: Ugh. Don't call me that. You can call me... Randy.
LOKI: God. Now I understand why Thor found this so annoying. Listen, enough with your games. I've been trying to help you. I kept them vulnerable at the Renaissance Fair for some time.
THE VARIANT / RANDY: Oh, gosh, and that was just so nice of you. But after eight to ten seconds of consideration, the answer is no. I'm not interested in ruling the Time Variance Authority.
HUNTER C-20: It's real. It's real. It was real. It was real.
MOBIUS: What's real? What's...
HUNTER C-20: It's real.
HUNTER D-90: She's off the dial.
HUNTER C-20: It's real.
MOBIUS: Look at me.
HUNTER C-20: It's real. I wanna go home.
MOBIUS: We're gonna get you there. Call the TVA, let the infirmary know...
HUNTER C-20: No, no, no. I gave it away. I gave it away.
HUNTER D-90: What did you give away...
HUNTER C-20: The Time-Keepers, where they are. I gave it away how to find them.
HUNTER D-90:  B-15, what is your status?
HUNTER D-90:  ''B-15, come in. What's your status?''
HUNTER D-90:  ''B-15, do you copy?''
LOKI: If you don't wanna rule the TVA, then what do you want?
THE VARIANT / RANDY: It doesn't matter. You're too late.
LOKI: Well I think you'll find I'm well ahead of schedule. I found your hiding place like that. I'd say that makes me the superior Loki, wouldn't you?
LOKI: I see. That's your plan. Lure us all here so you can blow the place up.
LOKI: I miss Randy.
THE VARIANT / MAN: Thank you for helping me stall for time. You really do love to hear yourself talk.
LOKI: You're the first person to tell me that.
LOKI: I would never treat me like this.
LOKI: Hi.
LOKI: Oh, come on. Stop hiding.
LOKI: If you had any honor you'd fight me as yourself.
THE VARIANT / MAN: I have shit to do.
LOKI: Enough!
HUNTER B-15: Mobius.
MOBIUS: Where is he?
HUNTER B-15: I lost him.
MOBIUS: What happened?
HUNTER B-15: I...
HUNTER D-90: Looks like your favorite Loki betrayed you.
MOBIUS: Just move!
LOKI: What do you want from me? What is this about?
THE VARIANT / MAN:  Brace yourself, Loki.
LOKI RECORCING: What do you want from me? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? What is this about? What do you want from me? What is this about? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? What is this about? What is this about?
THE VARIANT: This isn't about you.
LOKI: Right.
MOBIUS: Where they going?
CHRONOMONITOR: That's not possible.
ANALYST 1182-E: This is Analyst 1182-E, uh, reporting a code, uh, 000. Branches rapidly forming at a slope...
CHRONOMONITOR: Somebody just bombed the Sacred Timeline.
MOBIUS: Loki! Loki, wait! Wait! Loki, wait! No! Wait, Loki!
MOBIUS: Damn it!
LOKI: Is this the greatest power in the universe?
MOBIUS: A fugitive Variant's been killing our Minutemen.
MOBIUS: Whoever this Variant is, we haven't been able to find him.
LOKI: The Time Variance Authority and the gods of Asgard, one and the same. Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.
RENSLAYER: The Time-Keepers are monitoring every aspect of this case.
LOKI: He's hiding in apocalypses.
THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15: You're the fool the TVA brought in to hunt me down.
LOKI: Me, I presume. I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.
THE VARIANT / RANDY: I'm not interested in ruling the Time Variance Authority.
HUNTER C-20: I gave it away. The Time-Keepers, where they are.
LOKI: What do you want?
MOBIUS: No! No! Loki, wait! Wait! Loki, wait! No! Wait, Loki!
HUNTER C-20: We could do potato skins or buffalo fingers...
SYLVIE: Or we could eat somewhere else.
HUNTER C-20:  Why do you hate this place?
SYLVIE: I don't hate it, I fear it. Do you know how many times the health department has closed this place down?
HUNTER C-20: Well, the drinks seem fine.
HUNTER C-20: Oh, God! Ah, brain freeze!
SYLVIE: You know what brain freeze is, don't you?
HUNTER C-20:  Here we go.
SYLVIE: It's when you sip something so cold...
HUNTER C-20: Brain freeze associated with coldness... Got it.
SYLVIE: Wait, I'm being serious. So, it permeates the roof of your mouth and it freezes the synapses in your brain. So, your memories are literally frozen in place.
HUNTER C-20: That is absolutely not true.
SYLVIE: It is! Okay. Try it. Whatever you're thinking about will get frozen in place. I'm gonna ask you a question, and you won't be able to answer until the synapses have melted.
HUNTER C-20: Challenge accepted.
HUNTER C-20: Okay, ask.
SYLVIE: How many people are guarding the Time-Keepers?
HUNTER C-20: I'm sorry, what?
SYLVIE: Hey, how long have we been best friends?
HUNTER C-20: Too long.
HUNTER C-20: Seriously though, you know you can tell me anything, right?
SYLVIE: Of course.
HUNTER C-20: So why won't you tell me how many people are guarding the Time-Keepers?
HUNTER C-20: Oh, well, there's...
HUNTER C-20: This place, I... I remember, I know this place. But I don't know you.
SYLVIE: It's okay. You're just tired.
HUNTER C-20: Yeah. I'm probably just tired.
SYLVIE: How do I find the elevators?
HUNTER C-20: They're gold.
ANNOUNCER: All Minutemen to armory. Protect the timeline. All Minutemen to armory. Protect the timeline.
MINUTEMAN: I don't know, sir.
ANNOUNCER: All Minutemen to armory. Protect the timeline.
Guard: Hey! Stop!
LOKI: A few questions.
SYLVIE: Have you really got nothing else better to do?
LOKI: Rude. Are you sure you're a Loki?
SYLVIE: You're in my way.
LOKI: You ''are'' my way.
LOKI: I thought perhaps we could work together.
LOKI:  But now I see you lack vision.
LOKI: So, either you'll come willingly...
LOKI: Or you won't. Either way, that's how I get to meet the Time-Keepers.
SYLVIE: Oh, God. Shut up!
RENSLAYER: Hey!
SYLVIE: Come any closer and I'll kill him.
RENSLAYER:  Go for it.
SYLVIE: Get off my leg!
SYLVIE: Goodbye, Variant.
MISS MINUTES: You're outta juice.
SYLVIE: It's not working.
LOKI: Right...
SYLVIE: Just give it to me. You don't even know how to Recharge it.
LOKI: Of course I do. You're not the only tech savvy Loki.
SYLVIE: Don't ever call me that.
LOKI: Tech savvy?
SYLVIE: No, a Loki.
SYLVIE: So you're just fully a magician then?
LOKI: Fine. For my next trick, I'll make you disappear.
LOKI: Is that one of your powers?
SYLVIE: Where did you send us?
SYLVIE: You idiot! This is Lamentis-1.
LOKI: I don't know what that means!
SYLVIE: The moon that planet is about to crash into and destroy.
SYLVIE: Of all of the apocalypses saved on that TemPad, this is the worst! No one makes it off here! Watch out!
LOKI: I'm sorry, madam. Didn't have time to scan the brochure.
LOKI: By the way, I thought you wanted me dead.
SYLVIE: I don't know where you hid that TemPad, but if you blow up, it blows up, and then I end up blown up. There!
LOKI: So we're a team now?
SYLVIE: Oh, God, no!
LOKI: Get down!
SYLVIE: Didn't need your help!
LOKI: You're so weird!
LOKI: What are you doing?
SYLVIE: What are you doing?
LOKI: You trying to enchant me? It won't work.
SYLVIE: Why? Because you're a magician?
LOKI: No, because my mind is too strong.
SYLVIE: Fine!
LOKI:  Look. Are we really about to do this here? Again?
SYLVIE: Well what do you propose instead?
LOKI: I don't know. A truce?
LOKI: Listen, neither of us is getting off this rock if we can't turn that TemPad turned back on.
SYLVIE: Where do you have it hidden?
LOKI: In my heart.
SYLVIE: Well, then, I'll cut it out.
LOKI: Nice. Very droll. Lovely. Okay, yes, I do have the TemPad, but I'm not gonna get very far if you keep trying to kill me every thirty seconds.
SYLVIE: Well you're full of it because you need me to get that thing recharged. That's the only reason you saved me out there.
LOKI: Maybe. Yeah. I mean, sure. That too. Or we could slaughter each other here in this abandoned mining shack. What do you say?
SYLVIE: Good for me.
SYLVIE: The plan you interrupted was years in the making. Years!
LOKI: Okay, got it.
SYLVIE: And as soon as I turn that TemPad back on, I'm going straight back to the TVA to finish what I started.
LOKI: Good.
SYLVIE: I'll kill you then.
LOKI: Or I'll kill you.
LOKI: Where're you going?
SYLVIE: There's power somewhere on this moon. We just need enough of it to travel through inter-dimensional time and space.
SYLVIE: Jeez!
LOKI: Yep.
LOKI:  So, what's the plan?
SYLVIE: There's a town near here. And can you shut up? Just because I have to work with you doesn't mean I wanna hear your voice.
LOKI: All right, well... Slow down, Variant.
SYLVIE: What part of imminent death confuses you? And don't call me "Variant."
LOKI: I'm sorry, but I'm not calling some faded photocopy of me "Loki."
SYLVIE: Good. 'Cause that's not who I am anymore. I'm Sylvie now.
LOKI: Oh you changed your name. Brilliant.
SYLVIE: It's called an alias.
LOKI: Well it's not very Loki-like.
SYLVIE: Yeah? What exactly makes a Loki a Loki?
LOKI:  Independence, authority, style.
SYLVIE: So, naturally you went to work for the boring, oppressive time police.
LOKI: I don't work for them. I'm a... consultant.
SYLVIE: You don't know what you want.
LOKI: Oh, yeah? What about you? Your years-in-the-making plan was to tear the place down, create the ultimate power vacuum, and then just walk away. I'd never have done that.
SYLVIE: Yeah? Well, I'm not you. Can we get on with this now?
LOKI: It looks like everyone already fled.
SYLVIE: If they did, it was in vain.
LOKI: How long do we have?
SYLVIE: Twelve hours or so. Things down here are only gonna get worse. More meteors, gravity quakes, and of course, the collapse of society in the face of annihilation.
LOKI: Could that charge the TemPad?
SYLVIE: Maybe.
SYLVIE: I'm just checking the coupling. Making sure it can connect.
LOKI: Right.
SYLVIE: Okay. Hand it over.
LOKI: Pitiful. I'm not giving it to you. You're gonna have to try harder than that.
SYLVIE: Then don't give me your "tech savvy" ideas either. The TemPad requires a massive power source, not a night light.
LOKI: Brute force is no substitute for diplomacy and guile.
SYLVIE: Noted.
LOKI: It's remarkable that you ever made it as far as you did. Sorry about that.
WOMAN: Don't be. I enjoyed it.
LOKI: Oh...  I did too. But I can assure you, despite my acquaintance behaving like an animal...
LOKI: ...uh, we mean you no harm. We're simply weary travelers.
WOMAN: Sure you are.
LOKI / PATRICE: Hello, dear.
WOMAN: Patrice?
LOKI / PATRICE: It... It's been a long time. You're as beautiful as I've...
WOMAN: Patrice never said a thing that nice in 30 years. You're no travelers, you're devils.
SYLVIE: Which one was that? Diplomacy? Or...
LOKI: Don't. Just don't.
WOMAN: What do you devils want with me?
SYLVIE: We just wanna ask you a question. Where is everyone?
WOMAN: The ark. The evacuation vessel.
SYLVIE: Something like that would have enough juice to repower the TemPad.
LOKI: How do we get there?
WOMAN: Train station's the edge of town. But you'll never get a ticket.
SYLVIE: Come on, let's go.
GUARD: Quiet down! Get back!
WOMAN IN LINE: What's going on? The ark leaves tonight and we've been waiting in line for hours. For hours.
LOKI: Well, this looks fun.
SYLVIE: Come on.
LOKI: We can't fight our way onto that train.
SYLVIE: Who said anything about fighting?
LOKI: All your plans involve fighting.
SYLVIE: Not this one. I'm going to enchant a guard, have him lead us through the crowd, and if anyone gives us any trouble...
LOKI: Make him start shooting? And then what, kill every guard and hijack the train?
SYLVIE: Whether or not there's a fight is entirely up to them.
LOKI: We're doing this one my way.
LOKI: How do I look?
SYLVIE: Like someone with a shit plan.
LOKI: It's a great plan.
SYLVIE:  Hmm.
LOKI: Just follow my lead.
WOMAN: Why can't we get on?
MAN: Let us in! Come on!
GUARD: To Shuroo? This way, sir.
MAN 2: Let us in! Women and children...
WOMAN IN LINE: They're only giving tickets out to the wealthy! What about us?
PRIVATE HUDSON: Tickets?
PRIVATE HUDSON: Whoa! Hey!
LOKI: Taking this one to Shuroo.
PRIVATE HUDSON: Okay. And the tickets?
LOKI: Orders come from the top to get her on this train.
PRIVATE HUDSON:  Sir, this...
CORPORAL HICKS: Everything okay?
PRIVATE HUDSON: Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah, I just remembered that headquarters radioed in their request for them this morning.
CORPORAL HICKS: Okay.
LOKI: Okay.
PRIVATE HUDSON: Tickets?
LOKI: Good evening, passengers. Hi.
LOKI: Um, uh, look, I can't go backwards on a train.
SYLVIE: Well, I never sit with my back to a door.
LOKI: What? There are doors on both sides.
SYLVIE: Oh, just sit down.
SYLVIE: FYI, that wasn't even a plan.
LOKI: Oh, really?
SYLVIE: Plans have multiple steps. Dressing as a guard and getting on a train is just doing a thing.
LOKI: Oh, you a bit tired? Feel free to, you know, get some rest.
SYLVIE: I can't sleep in a place like this.
LOKI: You can't sleep on a train?
SYLVIE: No. I can't sleep around untrustworthy people.
LOKI:  Oh, right. That me?
SYLVIE: But you feel free to take a nap.
LOKI: Nice try.
SYLVIE: I'm not gonna waste my time rooting around for the TemPad when someone taught you fairly decent magic.
LOKI: My mother.
SYLVIE:  What was she like?
LOKI: She was, um... A Queen of Asgard. She was good. Purely decent.
SYLVIE:  Are you sure she was your mother?
LOKI: Oh, no, she's not actually. I was adopted. Is that a bit of a spoiler for you? Sorry about that.
LOKI: No, I knew I was adopted.
LOKI: What? They told you?
SYLVIE: Yeah. Did they not tell you?
LOKI: No. I mean, I mean, they, they did eventually. Hang on a second. So, tell... Tell me about your mother.
SYLVIE: I barely remember her. Just blips of a dream at this point.
LOKI: You know, when I was young, she'd do these little bits of magic for me. Like turn a flower into a frog or cast fireworks over the water. It all seemed impossible. But she told me that I'd be able to do it too because... Because I could do anything. You wanna see?
SYLVIE:  Not bad.
LOKI: She was the kinda person you'd want to believe in you.
SYLVIE: Sounds like she does.
LOKI: Well, she did. So, where'd you learn to do the... You know, the... Whatever it is?
SYLVIE: I taught myself.
LOKI: You taught yourself that magic?
SYLVIE: Yeah, I did.
LOKI: What, do you just... You just go into their minds and project some sort of illusion?
SYLVIE: Really it'd be easier if I just...
LOKI:  Enchanted me and take the TemPad and leap out the train? No, thank you.
SYLVIE: Well then, don't ask.
LOKI:  Okay.
WAITRESS: Champagne?
LOKI: Ah, yes. Thank you very much.
SYLVIE: No, I'm good, thanks.
LOKI: Oh, I'll take hers. Thank you. Cheers. To the end of the world. A pity the old woman chose to die, don't you think?
SYLVIE: She was in love.
LOKI: She hated him.
SYLVIE: Maybe love is hate.
LOKI: Should probably remember that. What was that?  "Love is... Love is hate."
SYLVIE: Oh, piss off!
LOKI: So, on the subject of love, is there a lucky beau waiting for you at the end of this crusade?
SYLVIE: Yeah, there is, actually.
LOKI: Oh.
LOKI: Managed to maintain quite a serious long-distance relationship with a postman whilst running across time from one apocalypse to another.
LOKI:  And with charm like that, who could resist you?
SYLVIE: Well, people are quite willing in the face of certain doom.
LOKI: I'm sure they are.
SYLVIE: It was only ever just to keep me going. How about you? You're a prince. Must've been would-be-princesses or perhaps, another prince.
LOKI: A bit of both. I suspect the same as you. But, nothing ever...
SYLVIE: Real.
LOKI: Mmm...
SYLVIE: Love is mischief, then.
LOKI: No. Love is... uh, something I might have to have another drink to think about.
SYLVIE: You do realize we're about to try and hijack the power source to a civilization's only hope?
LOKI: I do.
SYLVIE: It's not gonna be easy. We should rest.
LOKI: All right. You relax your way and I'll relax mine.
LOKI: <br /> ...når hun synger hun synger kom hjem,<br /> men tranene danser og fosserne stanser.<br />
LOKI & EVERYONE: <br /> When she sings, she sings come home<br /> When she sings, she sings come home
LOKI: <br /> Men tranene danser og fossene stanser<br /> når hun synger hun synger kom hjem,<br /> men tranene danser og fosserne stanser
SYLVIE: Where's your uniform?
LOKI & EVERYONE: <br /> When she sings, she sings come home<br /> When she sings, she sings come home<br /> When she sings, she sings come home<br /> When she sings, she sings come home
LOKI: <br /> I stormsvarte fjell, jeg vandrer alene<br /> Over isbreen tar jeg meg frem<br /> I eplehagen står møyen den vene<br /> og synger “når kommer du hjem?”
LOKI: <br /> Men tranene danser og fossene stanser<br /> når hun synger, hun synger kom hjem<br /> men tranene danser og fossene stanser<br /> When she sings, she sings come home
LOKI & EVERYONE: <br /> When she sings, she sings come home
LOKI: To Sylvie, everybody!
LOKI: Another!
SYLVIE: You're drunk.
LOKI: No, I'm just full. But bear in mind, I'm ''very'' full. Now, I need you to try this. It pairs very nicely with the Figgy Port. Who's got the Figgy Port? Well you'll just have to take my word on the Figgy Port, but...
SYLVIE: Where's your uniform? We're meant to be laying low.
LOKI: Nobody cares. It's the end of the world.
SYLVIE: I think something's happening.
LOKI: Yes. Uh, that planet is about to crash into us.
SYLVIE: Don't be an ass. I saw some people looking at you weirdly.
LOKI: What?
LOKI: When did you get so paranoid?
SYLVIE: Oh I guess it must have started when I spent my entire life running from the omniscient fascists you work for.
LOKI: It's a shame to let that go to waste. Hey! Change of subject. I thought of an answer.
SYLVIE: To what?
LOKI: Your question. Love is a dagger. It's a weapon to be wielded far away or up close. You can see yourself in it. It's beautiful. Until it makes you bleed. But ultimately, when you reach for it...
SYLVIE: It isn't real.
LOKI: Yeah.
SYLVIE: Love is an imaginary dagger.
LOKI: ... It doesn't make sense, does it?
SYLVIE: No. Terrible metaphor.
LOKI: Damn. I thought I had something there.
MAN: That's him.
SYLVIE: Stay cool.
LOKI: It's gonna be fine.
CORPORAL HICKS: Sir, can I see your tickets?
LOKI:  You again. Hello. Um, tickets. Yes, of course. Here they are.
LOKI: Oops. Still, it looks lovely, doesn't it?
LOKI: Look, is this really necessary? There is a simple explanation... Hey.
GUARD: Get out of the way.
SYLVIE: Awful throw.
LOKI: Oh, will you stop it?
LOKI: Bye.
SYLVIE: TemPad.
LOKI: Well, that's not ideal.
SYLVIE: Give me the TemPad.
LOKI: All right all right. All right. Okay.
LOKI: Well, I did take quite the tumble.
SYLVIE: You asshole. You killed us.
LOKI: Maybe we can fix it. Okay? Um...
SYLVIE: You're not a serious man.
LOKI: You're right. I'm a god.
SYLVIE: You're a clown. You got drunk on the train.
LOKI: I'm hedonistic. That's what I do.
SYLVIE: I'm hedonistic. A lot more than you, I assure you. But never at the expense of the mission.
LOKI: Oh, the mission? The mission? What, your glorious purpose? Give me a break. You can't beat them.
LOKI:  Okay.
LOKI: Did the, uh, scream make you feel better?
SYLVIE: Yes, it did. You should try it sometime.
LOKI:  What now?
SYLVIE: I don't know. You broke the TemPad.
LOKI: Well...
SYLVIE: And that planet is about to crash into us.
LOKI: Well, yes, but...
SYLVIE: Yes, but what?
LOKI: Well, the entire moon is destroyed, right?
SYLVIE: Yep. And everyone on it is killed.
LOKI: Including us.
SYLVIE: Yes, including us.
LOKI: What about the ark?
SYLVIE: The ark never leaves because it's destroyed.
LOKI: Never had us on it.
SYLVIE: So what? We hijack the ark and make sure it gets off this moon?
LOKI: I mean, sounds like a good idea to me.
SYLVIE: Okay.
LOKI: Really?
LOKI: You know, I don't think I've ever walked this much in my life.
SYLVIE: That's a pretty good life.
LOKI: Well, you're lucky you missed it. Here's an idea. What if you enchanted me and you could walk for both of us? I take a nap in my subconscious, and then you could just wake me when we arrive. Yeah?
SYLVIE: Yeah, that's not how enchantment works.
LOKI: All right, how does it work?
SYLVIE: Doesn't matter.
LOKI: You know, I feel like I've told you so much about me. I really don't know the first thing about you.
SYLVIE: Thanks for the tactical advantage.
LOKI: Ah, so, you want to use that tactical advantage to kill me when the TVA shows up.
SYLVIE: Worried, are you?
LOKI: I just need to know if I can trust you.
SYLVIE: Okay, fine. You want to know how enchantment works. I have to make physical contact and then grab hold of their mind.
LOKI: How?
SYLVIE: It depends on the mind. Most are easy and I can overtake them instantly. Others, the stronger ones, it gets tricky. I'm in control, but they're there, too. In order to preserve the connection, I have to create a fantasy from their memories.
LOKI: And you call me a magician.
SYLVIE: That young soldier from the TVA, her mind was messed up. Everything clouded. I had to pull a memory from hundreds of years prior, before she even fought for them.
LOKI: What? What'd you say? Before she joined the TVA?
SYLVIE: Yeah. She was just a regular person on Earth.
LOKI: A regular person?
SYLVIE: Loved margaritas.
LOKI: I was told that everyone who works for the TVA was created by the Time-Keepers.
SYLVIE: That's ridiculous. They're all Variants, just like us.
LOKI: They don't know that.
ANNOUNCER: All ticketed passengers, report to...
SYLVIE: That's our ride.
ANNOUNCER: Ten minutes until launch.
ANNOUNCER: Final boarding call.
SYLVIE: Do we trust each other?
LOKI: We do and you can.
SYLVIE: Good. Because this is gonna suck.
GUARD: Remain calm. We're now at capacity. Please return to your homes. Stand back!
CROWD:  Let us on! Let us on!
ANNOUNCER: Five minutes until launch.
LOKI: They're gonna let these people die.
ANNOUNCER: Five minutes until launch.
SYLVIE: We have to get on that ark and make sure it takes off.
LOKI: How?
SYLVIE: We go around.
LOKI: Okay.
GUARD: Return to your homes.
GUARD: Get back! Stand back!
LOKI: You okay?
SYLVIE: Yeah.
GUARD: Hold it! Stop right there.
SYLVIE: Just go.
SYLVIE: Over here!
MAN 2: You're gonna be okay.
MAN 3: No! No, wait!
SYLVIE: Run!
SYLVIE: Watch out!
LOKI: I've got it!
SYLVIE: Come on. Let's go!
LOKI: We can still make it!
LOKI: Sylvie, come on!
LOKI: So, you're part of the TVA's courageous and dedicated workforce?
MOBIUS: Yes.
LOKI: You were created by the Time-Keepers?
MOBIUS: Correct.
RAVONNA: You're not the only analyst working for me.
MOBIUS: But, would you say, maybe, I'm your favorite one?
LOKI: Enchantment is a clever trick.
SYLVIE: I have to create a fantasy from their memories. That young soldier from the TVA, she was just a regular person on Earth.
SYLVIE: Of all of the apocalypses saved on that TemPad, this is the worst! No one makes it off here!
LOKI: How long do we have?
SYLVIE: Twelve hours or so. Things down here are only gonna get worse.
LOKI: To the end of the world.
YOUNG SYLVIE: ... dragon swoops towards the palace, the Valkyrie flies over, and defeats the dragon, and saves Asgard.
RAVONNA: There's our Variant.
RAVONNA: On the authority of the Time-Keepers, I hereby arrest you for crimes against the Sacred Timeline. Reset it.
YOUNG SYLVIE: Wait!
MAN: No! No!
YOUNG SYLVIE: Help him!
JUDGE: Next case!
JUDGE: Next case!
RAVONNA: Right here!
MOBIUS: What'd they say? Are you okay?
RAVONNA: No, no, Mobius. I'm not. Under the best of circumstances, it's jarring to stand before the Time-Keepers. And this is not the best of circumstances.
MOBIUS: Yeah, but they can't blame you.
RAVONNA: They can and do. The Variant was right here. What if she got to the Time-Keepers?
MOBIUS: I know. But she didn't.
RAVONNA: No. But she got away. Along with the Variant that I got you permission to bring in here. Do you have any idea how impossible it is to keep the timeline stable? The Time-Keepers are all that stand between us and full-scale calamity.
MOBIUS: And I'm glad they're on our side. But if they want me to find Loki and the Variant, I need access to Hunter C-20.
RAVONNA: I'm sorry, but that's impossible.
MOBIUS: Look, when we found her, she kept saying, "It's real. It's real." Over and over. I need to find out what that meant and what else she saw when she was with the Variant. Look, I know there's protocol, but she could have information...
RAVONNA: She's dead, Mobius!
MOBIUS: What? How?
RAVONNA: The Variant, she enchanted C-20, scrambled her mind.
MOBIUS: I don't get it. She seemed okay. She seemed fine.
RAVONNA: At first, yes. But by the time she got in here, she could barely speak. The decline was steeper after that.
MOBIUS: I didn't know. What...
RAVONNA: Nobody does. We don't want people to panic. Can I trust you to keep that between us?
MOBIUS: Of course. Yes. I'm sorry.
RAVONNA: Every moment those Variants are out there, we're all in danger. Find them!
LOKI: I'm sorry.
SYLVIE: I remember Asgard. Not much, but I remember. My home, my people, my life. The universe wants to break free, so it manifests chaos. Like me being born the Goddess of Mischief. And as soon as that created a big enough detour from the Sacred Timeline, the TVA showed up, erased my reality, and took me prisoner. I was just a child. I escaped. Stole a TemPad and I ran for a long, long time, which really sucked. Everywhere and every-when I went, it caused a nexus event. Sent up a smoke flare. Because I'm not supposed to exist. Until, eventually, I figured out where to hide. And so that's where I grew up, the ends of a thousand worlds. Now... that's where I'll die.
ANALYST 1: There's nothing, sir.
MOBIUS: Even with the magnified nexus threshold? That one should be setting off alarms if somebody steps on the wrong leaf.
ANALYST 2: Wherever they are, I'm not sure anything survives.
MOBIUS: Yeah. Don't underestimate them. You see anything down at Roxxcart?
HUNTER B-15: They're gone. Leaping across time, plotting their next massacre. Any news on C-20?
MOBIUS: No.
HUNTER B-15: We need to find them.
MOBIUS: We will.
SYLVIE: Not long now. Do you think that what makes a Loki a Loki is the fact that we're destined to lose?
LOKI: No. We may lose. Sometimes painfully. But we don't die. We survive. I mean, you did. You were just a child when the TVA took you, but you nearly took down the organization that claims to govern the order of time. You did it on your own. You ran rings around them. You're amazing!
ANALYST 2: We've got something.
ANALYST 1: Temporal lock.
MOBIUS: Okay, that's not someone stepping on the wrong leaf. You ever seen a branch like that?
HUNTER B-15: No.
MOBIUS: Well?
LOKI: Well, what?
MOBIUS: I know you got some quip you're dyin' to say.
LOKI: Oh I don't have a quip. I've got nothing to say.
MOBIUS: Come on.
LOKI: By the way, I should have an equal amount of security. This is insulting!
MOBIUS: You just can't help yourself.
LOKI: You betrayed me!
MOBIUS: You betrayed me!
LOKI: Oh grow up!
MOBIUS: You grow up.
MOBIUS: You know, it occurred to me that you're not really the God of Mischief.
LOKI: Oh, here it comes. The folksy, dopey insult from the folksy dope. What am I? The God of Self-Sabotage, yeah? The God of Back-Stabbing?
MOBIUS: Just kind of an asshole and a bad friend. Yeah, chew on that for a little bit. All right. It's ready.
LOKI: What is this?
MOBIUS: You'll see.
LOKI: Mobius!
MOBIUS: Okay. No, no, no, let him, one last desperate trick from the desperate trickster. Go ahead.
LOKI: The TVA is lying to you.
MOBIUS: Put him in.
LOKI: No.
LOKI: What? Seriously?
SIF: You.
LOKI: Sif!
SIF: You conniving, craven, pathetic worm. You did this.
LOKI: What?
LOKI: Ow.
SIF: I hope you know you deserve to be alone and you always will be.
LOKI: All right. A bad memory prison? How quaint.
LOKI: Ow! Some punishment. I remember exactly what I did after that. I went and had a nice, hot bath and a glass of wine, and I never thought about it again, because it was just a bit of fun.
SIF: You.
LOKI: Huh?
SIF: You conniving, craven, pathetic worm. You did this.
LOKI: Hang on.
LOKI: Ow.
SIF: I hope you know you deserve to be alone and you always will be.
LOKI: Just...
LOKI: Time loops. How lovely.
SIF: You. You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.
LOKI: Okay. Okay, Sif. Hang on.
SIF: No, you hear this. You deserve to be alone...
LOKI: And I always will be. All right, I get it. Listen. You are a reconstruction of a past event created by the organization that controls all of time. So you need to trust me and you need to help me escape. Yeah? Okay, good.
SIF: Pathetic.
MOBIUS: Hey.
RAVONNA: Shouldn't you be interrogating the Loki Variant?
MOBIUS: He's softening in the Time Cell, but while he marinates, I thought maybe I'd interview the other Variant.
RAVONNA: Oh, no. Just stick with your Loki and figure out what that nexus spike was.
MOBIUS: I know, but I think I can get there faster if I work 'em both together. Remember you said we have a part to play, and this is the part I play...
RAVONNA: Absolutely not. She's just too dangerous.
MOBIUS: Too dangerous? Come on, Ravonna. This is what I do.
RAVONNA: And this is what I do. Nobody speaks with that Variant.
MOBIUS: I mean, if there's a mastermind here, I don't think it's Loki.
RAVONNA: Good. Then he should be the easiest to break. Work your Loki and figure out what caused that spike. Time-Keepers are watching, Mobius.
MOBIUS: They're always watching. "Work your Loki, work your Loki." That ought to be my mantra.
HUNTER B-15:  You all right?
MOBIUS: Is she in there?
HUNTER B-15: Mm-hmm.
MOBIUS: They don't go gently, do they?
HUNTER B-15: Aren't you supposed to be interrogating your Variant pet?
MOBIUS: Just stretching my legs. You know, we brought in Kree, Titans, vampires. Why is it the two orphan demigods are such a pain in the ass?
HUNTER B-15: And yet it was your idea to bring in another one.
MOBIUS: I'm happy to share credit for that idea.
HUNTER B-15: Mobius? Did Loki say anything while you were in there?
MOBIUS: Yeah. He said the TVA is lying to me. Why?
HUNTER B-15: Just doing my job.
SIF: You.
SIF: You conniving, craven...
LOKI: Sif. Sif.
SIF: ...pathetic worm.
LOKI: Please, please, no more. Please, I beg you. I'm a horrible person. I get it. I really am. I cut off your hair because I thought it'd be funny. And it's not. Uh... I crave attention... because I'm... I'm a... I'm a narcissist. And I suppose it's... It's because I'm scared of being alone.
SIF: You are alone and you always will be.
MOBIUS: Okay, Loki. You ready to talk?
LOKI: Fancy technology. Threatening interrogation tactics. Seems you and I are in a loop of our own.
MOBIUS: Well, there's been a lot of water under the bridge since then.
LOKI: Certainly has.
MOBIUS: Okay, you said the TVA is lying to me. Go ahead. Or is that just a cockroach's survival mechanism kicking in?
LOKI: Let me out of this place, stop beating me up, and I'll tell you.
MOBIUS: Cockroach. Got it. How long have you been working for the Variant?
LOKI: Me? Working for her? Please.
MOBIUS: If you're not working for the Variant, what is it? You're partners?
LOKI: Absolutely not. She's difficult and irritating, and she tries to hit me all the time. No. Not partners, no.
MOBIUS: Yeah, I guess you don't do partners. Unless, of course, it benefits you, and you intend to betray them at some point.
LOKI: It was a means to an end, Mobius. Welcome to the real world. Down there, we're awful to one another to get what we want.
MOBIUS: Now I gotta have a prince tell me how the real world works? Why don't you just tell me what caused the nexus event on Lamentis?
LOKI: Let me say this again. I'm not going to tell you just so you can turn around immediately afterwards and prune me.
MOBIUS: I guess we've reached a dead end then.
LOKI: Okay, it's over.
MOBIUS: I'm going to miss these little tete-a-tetes.
LOKI: Me, too.
MOBIUS: One guy playing checkers, you, old Mobius playing chess, but, yeah, give my regards to Lady Sif.
LOKI: What... No. What? No, no, no. Please, not... Well, just wait, wait, wait.
MOBIUS: Yeah?
LOKI: Of course it was me pulling the strings all along. She came to me on Asgard a long time ago and then she took me to one of her apocalypses and that's where we hatched our plan together.
MOBIUS: Which is?
LOKI: Coming along very nicely, thank you.
MOBIUS: And the Variant?
LOKI: Doesn't matter. She's a pawn. Something very, very big is gonna happen. And when it does, I'll dispose of her.
MOBIUS: Well, we saved you the trouble there. She's already been pruned. So assume I do set you free...
LOKI: Hang on, wait. What'd you just say?
MOBIUS: What? Assume I do set you free.
LOKI: The Variant. She's gone?
MOBIUS: Yeah. Not before she took out two of ours. Yeah, she was going to her Time Cell, broke free. Hunter B-15 stepped in, popped her. So you might want to fire off a thank you note to Hunter B-15, because it looks like you're the superior Loki. I would've bet on her, but that's what makes a horse race.
LOKI: Good riddance.
LOKI: What's so funny?
MOBIUS: Come on. Look at your eyes. You like her.
LOKI: What?
MOBIUS: You like her. Does she like you?
LOKI: Was she pruned?
MOBIUS: I mean, no wonder you have no clue what caused the nexus event on Lamentis. Both of you were just swooning over each other.
LOKI: Mobius. Tell me the truth.
MOBIUS: It's the apocalypse. Two Variants of the same being, especially you, forming this kind of sick, twisted romantic relationship. That's pure chaos. That could break reality. It's breaking my reality right now. What a incredible seismic narcissist. You fell for yourself.
LOKI: Her name was Sylvie.
MOBIUS: Ah, Sylvie. Lovely. How do you spell that? Is that with an I-E or just an I?
LOKI: Is she alive?
MOBIUS: For now.
MOBIUS: And was infiltrating the TVA, was that always sort of the grand plan?
LOKI: Our interests are aligned.
MOBIUS: Overthrowing the Time-Keepers?
LOKI: Maybe they need to be overthrown.
MOBIUS: I ought to box your ears.
LOKI: Mobius, listen. If what Sylvie told me about this place is true, it affects all of us.
MOBIUS: Oh here we go. Now, you've already told me about 50 lies in the past 10 minutes.
LOKI: I'm not lying.
MOBIUS: And now, I'm supposed to believe your terrorist girlfriend.
LOKI: I'm telling you the truth. She's not my girlfriend.
MOBIUS: Whatever you want to call her. What, your female self that you have some demented crush on...
LOKI: You're all Variants! Everyone who works at the TVA. The Time-Keepers didn't create you. They kidnapped you from the timeline, and erased your memories. Memories she can access through enchantment. So before this, you had a past, maybe you had a family, a life.
MOBIUS: Nice try. That was good. You two, what a pair! Gosh! Unbelievable. Wherever you go, it's just death, destruction, the literal ends of worlds. Well, I'm gonna have to close this case now, 'cause I don't need you anymore. Yeah, or as you might say, our interests are no longer aligned.
LOKI: You know, of all the liars in this place, and there are a great many, you're the biggest.
MOBIUS: Why? 'Cause I lied about your girlfriend?
LOKI: Oh, no. That I can respect. I mean, the lies you tell yourself.
HUNTER B-15: Open the door.
SYLVIE: Hello... Oh, I don't know. Your name's a number. Can't read it from here.
HUNTER B-15: Come with me.
RAVONNA: Mobius?
MOBIUS: Oh, yeah.
RAVONNA: You okay?
MOBIUS: Yep, I'm good.
RAVONNA: Case closed.
MOBIUS: Yes.
RAVONNA: Cheers.
MOBIUS: Cheers.
RAVONNA: To putting all this behind us.
MOBIUS:  Amen.
RAVONNA: If you could go anywhere, anytime, where would it be?
MOBIUS: I can go anywhere, anytime.
RAVONNA: You know what I mean.
MOBIUS: Why wouldn't you let me interrogate Sylvie?
RAVONNA: Sylvie?
MOBIUS: The Variant, that's what Loki calls her. Why wouldn't you let me, you know, question her?
RAVONNA: I told you, we couldn't risk her escaping again.
MOBIUS: She wouldn't have escaped.
RAVONNA: The other Variant got away during your first interrogation, didn't he?
MOBIUS: Ouch.
RAVONNA: Come on. Anywhere and anytime on the timeline. Where'd you go?
MOBIUS: I like being here now, with you, doing the work.
RAVONNA: Fine. I received word from the Time-Keepers. They want to personally oversee the Variant's pruning. And they want you there, too.
MOBIUS: It's about time. Great. When, when did you first notice what was going on with C-20?
RAVONNA: Mobius, what is going on with you?
MOBIUS: Nothing.
RAVONNA: We did it.
MOBIUS: I know.
RAVONNA: The Time-Keepers are happy. Mission accomplished.
MOBIUS: It's great. Mission accomplished. It was just that she seemed fine when I... When I saw her. I mean, a little freaked, but fine.
RAVONNA: Well, she quickly wasn't fine.
MOBIUS: Okay.
RAVONNA: Okay. C-20? The Variant? All these questions, what are you getting at?
MOBIUS: I don't know. I... Something just seems a little off.
RAVONNA: Fine. You want the truth? I'm trying to protect you. Would you normally interview someone like that? Yeah. But the Variant scares the hell out of me, and I didn't want to see anything happen to you. C-20 lost her mind. She couldn't even form words by the end. I just couldn't deal with that happening to you or anyone else. Is that what you wanted to hear?
MOBIUS: Yeah, if it's the truth.
RAVONNA: You've been spending too much time with Lokis.
MOBIUS:  Yeah. I definitely have been spending too much time with Lokis.
RAVONNA: What we do here matters.
MOBIUS: I know.
RAVONNA: When we're out there fighting for the fate of the Sacred Timeline we're also fighting for this. For us. Friends against time, allies to the end. You've seen all of existence, same as me. So, you know, friendship like ours is uncommon. And worth fighting for. Same as the Sacred Timeline.
MOBIUS: It was a good speech.
RAVONNA: Thank you.
MOBIUS: I knew I was your favorite analyst. Was that so hard to admit? What are you gonna do with that trophy?
RAVONNA: Oh!
MOBIUS: Where's that gonna go?
RAVONNA: You're right. Let's see.
RAVONNA: Uh... How's that?
MOBIUS: Looks perfect. You're running out of room there. All right, I will see you later on.
RAVONNA: One drink?
MOBIUS: I had two, didn't I?
RAVONNA: Mobius! This is a career case. You sure you're okay?
MOBIUS: I'm just exhausted, dealing with all these Lokis.
RAVONNA: Fair enough. Let's finish this.
MOBIUS: For all time.
RAVONNA: Always.
MOBIUS: I'll see you up there. Thanks for the drink.
SYLVIE: Fine. You wanted a fair fight. I respect that.
HUNTER B-15: When you were in my head, I saw something. What did you do to me?
SYLVIE: I showed you your life before the TVA.
HUNTER B-15: That's a trick. It's a deception.
SYLVIE: No, it's not.
HUNTER B-15: I was created by the Time-Keepers.
SYLVIE: No. I can't create memories. I can only use what's already there. The Time-Keepers took your lives from you. From all of you. You're Variants. We're the same.
HUNTER B-15: Show me.
HUNTER B-15: I looked happy.
HUNTER B-15: What now?
HUNTER C-20: You're not hearing me. I was there. This was real, what I saw. This is a place that I've been. This wasn't the TVA. This was a memory. I lived down there. I went to that bar. I had friends. I had a whole life on the Sacred Timeline.
INTERROGATOR: Calm down.
HUNTER C-20: "Calm down"? I'm a Variant. So are you. So is every single person in this place.
INTERROGATOR: I'm ending this.
LOKI: I've heard it once, I've heard it a thousand times. "You. You conniving, craven, pathetic worm. You did this." Right?
MOBIUS: What are you doing?
LOKI: Passing the time.
MOBIUS: Do you care about this Variant?
LOKI: Sylvie? I'm not sure if "care" is the right word.
MOBIUS: Shut up.
LOKI: I think we've covered this back in there.
MOBIUS: Shut up! Do you really think you deserve to be alone? Loki!
LOKI: You told me to shut up.
MOBIUS: Do you believe you deserve to be alone?
LOKI: I don't know.
MOBIUS: Then you better figure it out quick, because the nexus event the two of you caused, I think whatever that connection is, can bring this whole place down. So we better understand...
LOKI: "We"?
MOBIUS: Do you swear she didn't implant those memories in Hunter C-20?
LOKI: Mobius, no. I believe her.
MOBIUS: So, I just have to trust the word of two Lokis?
LOKI: How about the word of a friend?
MOBIUS: You were right, about the TVA. You were right from the beginning. And if you wanna save her, you need to trust me. Can we do that?
LOKI: Yes.
MOBIUS: Okay. You could be whoever, whatever you wanna be, even someone good. I mean, just in case anyone ever told you different.
RAVONNA: I think you have something of mine.
MOBIUS: Yeah, I got all the way down there before I even realized I picked up yours.
MOBIUS: What's going on?
MOBIUS: What's the problem, Ravonna?
MOBIUS: You know where I'd go if I could go anywhere? Wherever it is I'm really from. Yeah, wherever I had a life before the TVA came along. Maybe I had a jet ski. That's what I'd like to do. Just riding around on my jet ski.
RAVONNA: Prune him.
RAVONNA: Wait for me at the elevator.
RAVONNA: Who was in here with her?
MINUTEMAN: Sorry, ma'am, B-15 insisted.
RAVONNA: Put out an alert for Hunter B-15. She too has been compromised by the Variant.
SYLVIE:  You okay?
RAVONNA: I've got them from here.
SYLVIE: Do you remember me?
RAVONNA: I do. What do you wanna say to me, Variant?
SYLVIE: What was my nexus event? Why did you bring me in?
RAVONNA: What does it matter?
SYLVIE: It was enough to take my life from me, lead to all of this. Must have been important. So, what was it?
RAVONNA: I don't remember.
RAVONNA: Gracious Time-Keepers, as promised, the Variants.
TIME-KEEPER 1: After all your struggle, at last, you've arrived before us.
TIME-KEEPER 2: What do you have to say for yourselves before you meet your end, Variants?
LOKI: Is that the only reason you brought us here? To kill us? I've lost track of the number of times I've been killed, so go ahead. Do your worst.
TIME-KEEPER 3: You and your bravado are no threat to us, Variant.
SYLVIE: Oh, no, I don't think you believe that. I think...
SYLVIE: I think you're scared.
TIME-KEEPER 1: No, Variant. You're nothing but a cosmic disappointment. Delete them.
SYLVIE: No, I'm not done with you yet.
HUNTER B-15: For all time. Always.
RAVONNA: Protect the Time-Keepers!
LOKI: A little help here?
SYLVIE: Here.
SYLVIE: Come on.
RAVONNA: This time I finish the job.
TIME-KEEPER 1: You're a child of the Time-Keepers too, Sylvie. We can talk.
SYLVIE: Oh, yeah?
LOKI: Wait.
LOKI: Don't.
SYLVIE: Fake. Mindless androids.
LOKI: It never stops.
LOKI: Then who created the TVA?
SYLVIE: I thought this was it.
LOKI: Sylvie...
SYLVIE: Not another pep talk, please.
LOKI: No, I have to tell you something. We will figure this out.
SYLVIE: How do you know that?
LOKI: Because, uh... Well, back on Lamentis... This is new for me. Um...
SYLVIE: What?
SYLVIE: What is it?
RAVONNA: Do it.
SYLVIE: No. You're gonna tell me everything. <poem> If the sun Should tumble from the sky If the sea Should suddenly run dry If you love me Really love me Let it happen I won't care If it seems That everything is lost I will smile And never count the cost If you love me Really love me Let it happen Darling, I Won't care Shall I catch a shooting star? Shall I bring it where you are? If you want me to, I will You can set me any task I'll do anything you ask If you'll only say you love me still When at last Our life on earth is through I will share Eternity with you If you love me Really love me Let it happen I won't care I you love me Really love me Let it happen Darling, I... </poem>
LOKI: Is this Hel? Am I dead?
VOICE: Not yet.
VOICE: But you will be unless you come with us.
RENSLAYER: Trusting this man is not a good idea.
MOBIUS: I can handle him. The TVA has pruned a lotta these guys, and no two are alike.
LOKI: You're all Variants! The Time-Keepers didn't create you. They kidnapped you from the timeline.
MOBIUS: The nexus event you caused, whatever that connection is, can bring this whole place down.
RENSLAYER: Fine. You want the truth? I'm trying to protect you. Friendship like ours is uncommon.
MOBIUS: You know where I'd go if I could go anywhere? Wherever it is I'm really from. Yeah, wherever I had a life before the TVA came along.
RENSLAYER: Prune him.
SYLVIE: The Time-Keepers took your lives from you. You're Variants. We're the same.
SYLVIE: Mindless androids.
LOKI: Then who created the TVA? Sylvie, I have to tell you something.
SYLVIE: You're gonna tell me everything.
LOKI: What is this place? Where are we? Who are you?
CLASSIC LOKI: This is The Void. That's Alioth. And we're his lunch. Come on!
SYLVIE: Give me your TemPad.
SYLVIE: Who's really behind the TVA?
RENSLAYER: I'm as in the dark as you are.
SYLVIE: Poor Judge Renslayer. Your whole reality's been destroyed. Tell me, how does it feel to be on the other side of it?
SYLVIE: This is it, isn't it? This is where you dragged me after you stole my life. A fitting place, then, to take yours.
RENSLAYER: And what if I said Loki wasn't dead? Not yet, anyway.
SYLVIE: I'd say you were lying.
RENSLAYER: Maybe. Or maybe we want the same thing.
SYLVIE: How is he still alive? And how will saving him get us closer to who's really behind the TVA?
RENSLAYER: It's complicated. I'm telling you this willingly.
SYLVIE: Why?
RENSLAYER: Because I wanna know who's at the top of this. I want to know who lied to me. When we prune a branched reality, it's impossible to destroy all of its matter. So we move it to a place on the timeline where it won't continue growing. Basically, the branched timeline isn't reset. It's transferred.
SYLVIE: To where?
RENSLAYER: A void at the end of time. Where every instance of existence collides at the same point and simply stops.
SYLVIE: Why?
RENSLAYER: I don't know. The dogma states that the end of time is still being written, that the Time-Keepers are transforming it into utopia.
SYLVIE: That's nice. Super believable.
RENSLAYER: Whatever the real reason... nothing ever comes back from there. I can help you if you trust me. ''The Lokis walk
LOKI: I suggest we take a breather, so I can ask several thousand questions.
CLASSIC LOKI: Gotta keep moving so we don't die.
LOKI: I can get behind that, but what's your plan?
CLASSIC LOKI: Don't die.
LOKI: Okay, understood, but beyond that?
CLASSIC LOKI: Don't die.
LOKI: That's not a plan. It's a general demand of living. If you're Lokis, you should always have a plan.
LOKI: Will someone please explain to me what the hel is going on? Look, it's been a very, very, very trying past few days. Months? I don't even know how long it's been since New York. All I know is, I got pruned and I woke up here, and now I'm surrounded by Variants of myself, plus an alligator, which I'm heartbroken to report I didn't even find all that strange. And now we're running from God knows what trying to get to God knows where. When I need to be trying to find a way back to the TVA.
KID LOKI: Stop wailing or you will signal Alioth.
LOKI: You mean the monster in the sky?
LOKI: Thank you.
KID LOKI: This is the place where the TVA dumps its rubbish, everything they prune. And Alioth, he ensures none of it ever returns.
BOASTFUL LOKI: It's a living tempest that consumes matter and energy. They send entire branched realities here that are devoured in an instant.
CLASSIC LOKI: We're in a shark tank. Alioth is the shark.
CLASSIC LOKI: Oh, there's no such thing as an alligator tank. Besides, it's a better metaphor. He's overly sensitive like the rest of us.
LOKI: Hang on, you're telling me that thing's a Loki too?
CLASSIC LOKI: Oh, yes.
LOKI: Okay, fine. Willing to accept that. Why are there so many of you?
CLASSIC LOKI: Because Lokis survive. That's just what we do.
LOKI: Great. So how do we escape?
CLASSIC LOKI: We don't. All of us were arrested by the TVA and pruned, just like you. And just like you're doing right now, we all stood around making bad plans that went nowhere.
LOKI: Yes, but have you thought of using a TemPad?
BOASTFUL LOKI: Oh, the one thing that could easily get us out of here, yes. They're all over the place, right, guys?
LOKI: Fine. What about causing a nexus event?
BOASTFUL LOKI: The TVA doesn't care what happens here.
LOKI: Surely there's something to do.
CLASSIC LOKI: There is. Survive. That's all there is. All there ever was.
KID LOKI: We're done talking. Let's go. Just do what you want, I guess.
LOKI: Okay, wait, wait, wait. Why do you wear the horns? You let a child command you.
CLASSIC LOKI: You'll do well to respect the boy. This is his kingdom.
LOKI: Right. What was your nexus event, Your Majesty?
KID LOKI: I killed Thor.
CLASSIC LOKI: So, why did you want to return to the TVA so badly, anyway?
BOASTFUL LOKI: You leave your glorious purpose there?
LOKI: Something like that.
RENSLAYER: Miss Minutes, I need you to remote access a series of restricted files from the archives.
MISS MINUTES: Ooh, doggy! On what?
RENSLAYER: The beginning of time. The founding of the TVA.
MISS MINUTES: Right away.
SYLVIE: Wait. What about the end of time?
RENSLAYER: It's just a void.
SYLVIE: What if The Void isn't the end? What if there's something beyond it?
SYLVIE: Hiding in the shadow of apocalypses obscured me from the TVA because I couldn't create a diverging branch there, right? So if all of this is still being written, whatever happens is just a new timeline. It would be impossible to start a nexus event there. You could be completely undetectable.
RENSLAYER: That's it. That's the only place they could be.
SYLVIE: So how do we get past The Void?
RENSLAYER:  It's impossible. There's nothing for the TemPad to lock onto, no destination.
SYLVIE: Then we go through it.
RENSLAYER: That's suicide.
SYLVIE: Then I guess my need for you has passed.
MISS MINUTES: Wait. What about The Void spacecraft?
RENSLAYER: Yes, the prototype.
MISS MINUTES: Great. I'll get the file.
RENSLAYER: It's a spaceship designed to withstand the temporal void. It could take us to the end of time.
SYLVIE: Find Loki.
RENSLAYER: Find the man behind the curtain.
SYLVIE: And kill him.
RENSLAYER: Together.
SYLVIE: Miss Minutes, where are the files on this timecraft?
MISS MINUTES: Still lookin', hon.
SYLVIE: Nothing?
MISS MINUTES: Hmm. Buried pretty deep.
RENSLAYER: It's highly restricted. I might not even have clearance.
SYLVIE: Oh, no, I think you would. If it's real.
RENSLAYER: How long?
MISS MINUTES: Any second now.
GUARD:  Go! Go! Go! Move it!
GUARD: You hurt?
RENSLAYER: I'm fine, but she took my TemPad. Sylvie? Not thinking of going on the run, are you? We know where you hide. Sooner or later, we'll catch you. It must be so exhausting.
SYLVIE: I'll admit you had me fooled there for a minute. Or did you get a little real? Did Judge Renslayer really feel betrayed by her beloved TVA?
RENSLAYER: Why don't you come back out and we can talk about it?
SYLVIE: Sure. Just tell everyone else to piss off and we can settle this between us.
RENSLAYER: Works for me.
SYLVIE: What happened to finding the man behind the curtain?
RENSLAYER: Tell you what. You come out with your hands up and I'll put you in a time loop. Something not so bad. You can live out your days in a good memory. Do you have any good memories?
SYLVIE:  Just one, really.
GUARD: She self-pruned.
RENSLAYER: Good. Then she's dead, too.
BOASTFUL LOKI: So, after I vanquished Captain America and Iron Man,
I claimed my prize: all six Infinity Stones.
CLASSIC LOKI: That's alligator for growling and saying "liar" at the same time.
BOASTFUL LOKI: Well at least my nexus event wasn't eating the wrong neighbor's cat.
LOKI: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hey, hey, hey.
KID LOKI: Tell them your story, Loki.
CLASSIC LOKI: Me? Nobody wants to hear about that.
LOKI: I, I would, actually. Um... It's just I've, I've been wondering, because I'm... Well, we're supposed to die, right? Thanos kills us after Ragnarok.
CLASSIC LOKI: Thanos? In my timeline, everything proceeded correctly, my entire life, until Thanos attacked our ship.
LOKI: So you, you ''didn't'' try to stab him?
CLASSIC LOKI:  Certainly not. Oh take no offense, my friends, but blades are worthless in the face of a Loki sorcery. They stunt our magical potential.
BOASTFUL LOKI: But they look awesome.
CLASSIC LOKI: Oh, yes. Especially when they clatter to the ground just before your neck is snapped. I cast a projection of myself so real, even the Mad Titan believed it. Then hid as inanimate debris. After I faked my death, I simply drifted in space. Away from Thor, away from everything. Thought about the universe and my place in it, and it occurred to me that everywhere I went, only pain followed. So I removed myself from the equation, landed on a remote planet and stayed there in isolation, in solitude for a long, long time.
LOKI: How did the TVA find you?
CLASSIC LOKI: I got lonely. To tell you the truth, I missed my brother, and I wondered if he missed me, if anybody else did. But as soon as I took my first steps to getting off the planet, the TVA arrived. Because we, my friends, have but one part to play, the God of Outcasts. Nothing more. The God of Outcasts.
LOKI: I'm going.
CLASSIC LOKI: Going where?
LOKI: Out of this place, out of The Void, back to the TVA. We may be good at surviving, but we're also good at escaping. I'd wager that gives me a decent chance as any.
CLASSIC LOKI: You won't do either, you'll be brutally murdered.
LOKI: Well, so be it. That was my destiny to begin with.
KID LOKI: You're different. Why?
LOKI: No, I'm not, you see? I'm the same, really. I'm the same as all of you. Have any of you met a woman Variant of us?
CLASSIC LOKI: Sounds terrifying.
LOKI: Oh, she is. But that's kind of what's great about her. ''She's'' different. She's not trying to take over the TVA, she's trying to take it down. And she needs me. Now, you said Alioth is what keeps us here. You said it's a living thing. You said it's a shark. Well, if it lives, it dies. So I'm gonna kill the shark. I'm gonna kill Alioth, and I could use all the help I can get.
CLASSIC LOKI: Yeah, baby. Yeah.
LOKI:  Monsters.
CLASSIC LOKI: Oh, yeah!
PRESIDENT LOKI: Ah. Hello, which one of us are you?
LOKI:  This is a nightmare.
SYLVIE: You.
MOBIUS: Can you shut the door, we still got a little bit of a situation here. By the way, you should be careful just jumping into a stranger's car like that.
SYLVIE: Watch out!
MOBIUS: I see it, I see it.
SYLVIE: Really? Because you're driving right towards it.
MOBIUS: God, you really are one of you. Hang on.
CLASSIC LOKI:  You bastard! You led the wolves to our door.
PRESIDENT LOKI: We prefer snakes to wolves.
KID LOKI: I've eaten both. They die just the same.
BOASTFUL LOKI: Apologies, my liege. I betrayed you, and now, I'm king.
PRESIDENT LOKI: About that...
BOASTFUL LOKI: You can't be serious.
PRESIDENT LOKI: Come on. What did you expect?
BOASTFUL LOKI: That was not the bargain! I gave you our location. In exchange for shelter and supplies, you give me your army and I take the throne.
PRESIDENT LOKI: Ah, yes. Not so good a bargain. How about this one? My army, my throne?
ANOTHER LOKI: About that.
PRESIDENT LOKI: Why you beef-witted, half-faced scrubs. We had a deal!
BOASTFUL LOKI: For God's sake.
PRESIDENT LOKI: Why the hell is there an alligator in here?
CLASSIC LOKI & KID LOKI: He's a Loki!
BOASTFUL LOKI: Glorious purpose!
CLASSIC LOKI: Come on.
ANOTHER LOKI: Take that, Loki!
CLASSIC LOKI: Damn it! Animals, animals! We lie and we cheat, we cut the throat of every person who trusts us, and for what? Power. Glorious power. Glorious purpose! We cannot change. We're broken, every version of us. Forever.
KID LOKI: And whenever one of us dares try to fix themselves, they're sent here to die.
LOKI: That's why I need to get out of here. Nothing can change until the TVA is stopped.
CLASSIC LOKI: And you trust her?
LOKI: She's the only one I do trust. And right now, I believe she's our only chance of stopping the TVA.
KID LOKI: That's good enough for me.
CLASSIC LOKI: Okay. Okay, we'll help you. But approaching Alioth is a death sentence. We'll get you to it, but that's as far as we go.
MOBIUS: All that time, I really believed we were the good guys.
SYLVIE: Annihilating entire realities, orphaning little girls, classic hero stuff.
MOBIUS: Well, I guess when you think the ends justify the means, there's not much you won't do. By the way, you did some annihilating too.
SYLVIE: I did what I had to do.
MOBIUS: Yeah, so did I.
SYLVIE: You hunted me like a dog.
MOBIUS: I'm sorry about that.
SYLVIE: When I pruned myself, I thought I might be able to find Loki. That storm, that thing, it's likely already got him.
MOBIUS: You really believe that?
SYLVIE: It doesn't matter. The only thing that matters now is getting out of here and finding out who's behind all of this.
MOBIUS: Great. How do we do that?
SYLVIE: We turn around.
MOBIUS: Turn around? What, and go back to the angry cloud?
SYLVIE: Yeah. I think it might be the answer. We're going back to it.
CLASSIC LOKI: I have to say, it feels odd walking toward the gargantuan creature. Do you have a plan of action?
LOKI: Get inside, find its heart or brain or whatever, and then, you know, do it in.
KID LOKI: I mean...
LOKI: Okay just because it's not complicated doesn't mean it's bad.
KID LOKI: It also doesn't mean it's good.
LOKI: See? He's on board.
CLASSIC LOKI: He's praying. He thinks we're going to die.
SAILOR: All hands to battle stations!
LOKI: Alioth is like any animal. He'll go after the big meal first. And while he's busy with that, we can sneak around the back and...
SAILOR: Fire!
LOKI:  Okay. Maybe we, uh... think a bit more about this, huh?
KID LOKI: Car.
LOKI: What?
CLASSIC LOKI: Along the horizon.
LOKI: Is that bad?
KID LOKI: Well, usually means cannibalistic marauders or cannibalistic pirates.
LOKI: Delightful. Now they're slowing down.
CLASSIC LOKI: What are they doing?
KID LOKI: Just stay on guard.
LOKI: Sylvie.
CLASSIC LOKI: I don't understand. Is he a coward or was he being brave?
KID LOKI: I'm not too sure.
CLASSIC LOKI: Come on.
SYLVIE: You're alive.
LOKI: What happened? You okay?
LOKI: Mobius! How did you...
SYLVIE: We thought you could do with some backup.
LOKI: Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, these are my friends. Well, they're, um... How best to put this? Us as a child, us in the future, and us as an alligator. It's best not to question it.
MOBIUS: You throw a rock out here, you hit a Loki.
SYLVIE: So you're all after the giant cloud monster, too, then?
LOKI: Well, we haven't decided how we're going to kill it, but...
SYLVIE: Sorry, come again? Kill it?
LOKI: Yes, we're gonna kill Alioth.
SYLVIE: Oh, my God. That was your plan.
LOKI: Yeah.
SYLVIE: And you all went along with it?
KID LOKI: I had my doubts.
CLASSIC LOKI: Probably unsafe.
LOKI: All right, well, what's your plan, then?
SYLVIE: I think the person we're after is beyond The Void at the end of time. And if they are, that thing is just their guard dog protecting the only way in.
LOKI: Okay, so, um, how do we get past the guard dog?
SYLVIE: I'm gonna enchant it.
LOKI: That's insane, right?
SYLVIE: As insane as what? Paper-cutting a giant cloud to death?
LOKI: Listen, I've been down here longer than you, I know a thing or two...
SYLVIE: I'm going to enchant it.
MOBIUS: She's pretty confident.
RENSLAYER: Leave us.
HUNTER B-15: Why am I locked in here?
RENSLAYER: You freed the Variant. You were disloyal to the TVA.
HUNTER B-15: Disloyal?
RENSLAYER: Did you think you'd escape punishment for that?
HUNTER B-15: Disloyal to who? You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers. They weren't real.
RENSLAYER: And why does that changes anything?
HUNTER B-15: That changes everything! The people need to know the truth.
RENSLAYER: No, the TVA needs stability. And until we can figure out what's going on, that is what it will get. So you need to tell me everything.
HUNTER B-15: What exactly do you want from me?
RENSLAYER: You had a link with the Variant. I want you to tell me what drives her.
HUNTER B-15: Revenge drives her. Killing the Time-Keepers. But they turned out to be fake, in case you forgot. So she'll be searching for whomever created them. This isn't about protecting the TVA at all, is it? You just want to find whoever is behind all of this, too. You'll never find them. Not before she does.
RENSLAYER: And why is that?
HUNTER B-15: You only want it. She needs it.
MISS MINUTES: Hey, y'all.
RENSLAYER: I need all the files on the founding of the TVA. Everything from the beginning of time.
MISS MINUTES: Well, that's a mighty tall order.
RENSLAYER: Whoever created this place is in danger. I need to find them.
MISS MINUTES: Okay. Right away, ma'am.
CLASSIC LOKI: You really don't remember him?
MOBIUS: I mean, the TVA arrested a lot of Lokis, but, no, I don't remember an alligator. I mean, who's to say he's even a Loki Variant?
CLASSIC LOKI: He is green, isn't he?
MOBIUS: I don't know, he could be lying. The long con. Of course, that just makes him ''more'' likely to be a Loki. It's always the game within the game with you guys, which I respect.
KID LOKI: Mobius, assuming you do get back to the TVA, what exactly are you getting yourself into?
MOBIUS: I don't know. I'd like to let people know the truth. So just like that, you're turning on the very thing you devoted your life to.
MOBIUS: Well, it's never too late to change.
KID LOKI: I hope they know what they're doing.
SYLVIE: Mobius isn't so bad.
LOKI: Or so good. I think that's why we get along.
SYLVIE: He cares about you.
LOKI: It's cold.
SYLVIE: Mmm-hmm.
LOKI: I could conjure one for you, if you like.
SYLVIE: Tell you what, you could conjure me a new outfit. You have no idea how uncomfortable something like this is. So... Mobius and his, um... theory about...
LOKI: Oh right, right. About our nexus event.
SYLVIE: Total rubbish, right?
LOKI: Absolutely. Of course. I mean...
SYLVIE: I don't mean that it wasn't, you know, a nice moment.
LOKI: No, it was great. It was really nice. It was, it was great.
SYLVIE: It just sounds like another TVA lie.
LOKI: A hundred percent. I mean, totally. Yeah.
SYLVIE: I don't know how to do this.
LOKI: I don't even know what we're doing.
SYLVIE: I don't have friends. I don't have... anyone.
LOKI: Well... there are more important things, right?
SYLVIE: Right? Yeah. Like, like bringing down the TVA.
LOKI: I mean, saving the universe, even.
SYLVIE: Well, there's no need to be dramatic, but, yeah, kind of.
SYLVIE: It's not very snuggly.
LOKI:  Okay.
SYLVIE: Is it a tablecloth?
LOKI: No, it's a blanket.
SYLVIE: Thank you.
LOKI: My pleasure.
SYLVIE: How do I know that, in the final moments, you won't betray me?
LOKI: Listen, Sylvie, I... I betrayed everyone who ever loved me. I betrayed my father, my brother... my home. I know what I did. And I know why I did it. And that's not who I am anymore. Okay? I won't let you down.
SYLVIE: You sure? 'Cause if we make it, and the TVA is gone, there might be a timeline for you to rule.
LOKI: Ah. And then I'd finally be happy.
LOKI: What about you? What will you do when this is all over?
SYLVIE: I don't know.
LOKI: I don't know either. Maybe... Maybe we could figure it out... together.
SYLVIE: Maybe.
MOBIUS: Okay, so what's the next move?
SYLVIE: The TVA needs to be brought down. We don't know who created it or where they are, but that thing out there does. When it hit me earlier, I linked to it. It was brief, but I caught a glimpse of something, and I think if I can get close enough to it, I can enchant it, and it's gonna take me to whoever's behind all of this.
LOKI: I'm staying.
SYLVIE: Loki, I don't even know if this is gonna work.
LOKI: You go, I go.
KID LOKI: It's happening, guys. The branch will be right out there.
MOBIUS: I'll give your regards to Renslayer.
SYLVIE: Oh, please do.
MOBIUS: You boys want a ticket out of here?
KID LOKI: What? No. We're staying here.
CLASSIC LOKI: This is our home.
LOKI: Are you sure? What about Alioth?
CLASSIC LOKI: We've survived this long. We know what we're doing.
KID LOKI: Loki, you're gonna need this on your journey. Go on.
CLASSIC LOKI: Good luck. I hope you find what you're looking for.
MOBIUS: Looks like you got away in the end.
LOKI: I always do. What will you do at the TVA?
MOBIUS: Burn it to the ground. Thanks for the spark. Well, see you later, Loki.
LOKI: Thank you, my friend.
MOBIUS:  You're my favorite.
SYLVIE: When a branch appears, Alioth will focus on it. That's when I'll enchant it.
LOKI: What if we don't have time to wait for a branch?
SYLVIE: We'll have to cause a distraction.
LOKI: Come and get me!
LOKI:  No! This way! Come and get me!
LOKI: No! No!
SYLVIE: How is he doing that?
LOKI: I think we're stronger than we realize.
CLASSIC LOKI: Go!
LOKI: What are you doing?
SYLVIE: We're gonna enchant it.
LOKI: I don't know how.
SYLVIE: You do. Because we're the same!
CLASSIC LOKI: Glorious purpose!
SYLVIE: Open your eyes.
MOBIUS: You weren't born to be king, Loki. You were born to cause pain and suffering and death.
RAVONNA RENSLAYER: The Time-Keepers are all that stand between us and full-scale calamity.
MOBIUS: For all time.
RENSLAYER: Always.
HUNTER B-15 : Why am I locked in here?
RENSLAYER: You were disloyal to the TVA.
HUNTER B-15: You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers. They weren't real!
RENSLAYER: And why does that change anything?
HUNTER B-15: That changes everything!
MOBIUS: The nexus event the two of you caused, whatever that connection is, can bring this whole place down!
LOKI: This is new for me. Back on Lamentis...
RENSLAYER: I can help you if you trust me.
SYLVIE: The person we're after is beyond The Void at the end of time. That thing is just their guard dog protecting the only way in.
LOKI: How do we get past the guard dog?
SYLVIE: I'm gonna enchant it.
MOBIUS: She's pretty confident.
CLASSIC LOKI: Go!
SAM WILSON/FALCON: Way to go, Tic Tac!
HOPE VAN DYNE/WASP: That's how you punch.
T'CHALLA/BLACK PANTHER: Wakanda forever!
SCOTT LANG/ANT-MAN: You haven't heard of me.
NATASHA ROMANOFF/BLACK WIDOW: Let me put you on hold.
PETER QUILL/STAR-LORD: Dance-off, bro.
THOR: He's a friend from work!
STEVE ROGERS/CAPTAIN AMERICA: I can do this all day. Yeah, I know.
HANK PYM: I'll show you ferocity.
CAPTAIN MARVEL: Higher, further, faster, baby.
LOKI: We have a Hulk.
KORG: We're gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here. Wanna come?
MAN: We think of time as a one-way motion.
NEIL ARMSTRONG: One small step for man...
GRETA THUNBERG: How dare they!
MALALA YOUSAFZAI: My dream...
NELSON MANDELA: We have fought for the right to experience peace.
CLASSIC LOKI: Glorious purpose!
WOMAN: Motivated by women throughout the world.
VISION: What is grief, if not love persevering?
MAYA ANGELOU: I will rise.
SYLVIE: Open your eyes! '' Aren't you gonna tell me not to kick the door in? It never made a difference. Well, if you think it's a bad idea, I prefer you to speak your mind. No. Nothing to say. That'll be a first.
LOKI: Everything okay?
SYLVIE:  Yeah. Just need a moment.
LOKI: Right. It's just, you normally...
SYLVIE: Loki, shut up. I was pruned before you even existed. I have been waiting for this moment my entire life. I just need a second to get my head straight, okay?
LOKI: Sure. Of course.
MISS MINUTES: Hey, y'all.
SYLVIE: You again?
MISS MINUTES: Welcome to The Citadel at the End of Time. Come on.
MISS MINUTES: Congratulations. Y'all had an awfully long journey to get here. He's impressed. Who's impressed?
MISS MINUTES: He Who Remains. And who is he?
MISS MINUTES: He created all and he controls all. At the end, it is only He Who Remains. And he wants to offer you a deal. He's been making a few creative adjustments, and he's worked it out so we can reinsert both of y'all back into the Timeline in a way that won't disrupt things. "Won't disrupt things"?
MISS MINUTES: Mmm-hmm. The TVA can keep doin' its vital work and y'all can live the lives you've always wanted. And what have we always wanted?
MISS MINUTES: Now, don't play coy with me, mister. You know how you got into this mess. What?
MISS MINUTES: The Battle of New York, silly. You versus those self-righteous Avengers. How would you like to win? But not just there. You can kill Thanos. You want the Infinity Gauntlet? Yours. Throne of Asgard? No problem. What about you, missy? All those years on the run. Desperate, alone. How would you like to wake up tomorrow with just a lifetime of happy memories? Two Lokis in the same place. Both of us... together on the Timeline.
MISS MINUTES: It's crazy, but he could make it work. All of it. Everything. Exactly the way you've always wanted. And you can have it all, together.
SYLVIE: It's fiction. We write our own destiny now.
MISS MINUTES: Oh, sure you do. Good luck with that. Come on.
MISS MINUTES: Hey, there. What took you so long?
MISS MINUTES: Sorry. Some things had to get worked out, but I'm downloadin' the files you need now. This isn't what I asked for.
MISS MINUTES: I know, but he thinks this'll be more useful. Who?
MISS MINUTES: Happy readin'.
LOKI: He Who Remains.
SYLVIE: Not for much longer. Are we sure he's even still alive? This is wild. The two of you... ...same person. I mean, it's a little unnatural. But... Wow! Wild. He Who Remains. He Who Remains. She still calls me that? Creepy, right? But... I like it. Come on. Come on, let's talk in my office. Not what you were expecting, hmm? You're just... a man. Mmm. Flesh and blood. Don't tell me I'm a disappointment. No. Just a little bit easier to kill. Come on in.
HE WHO REMAINS: One... Two. Please, take a seat. Uh, Loki. Loki. Two sugars. I said I wasn't to be disturbed.
MOBIUS: Well, then you're not gonna be happy to see me. He's back. If anyone was ever gonna make it back from The Void, I suppose it was gonna be you.
MOBIUS: Oh, well, you know, one man's Void is another man's piece of cake. So, you're gonna prune me?
MOBIUS: I like that idea. But, you know, my standards might be a little bit higher in that area than yours. You know, with close personal friends. I'm sorry, Mobius. I couldn't let you get in the way of our mission.
MOBIUS: Mission? The Time-Keepers are fake. We're all Variants. What mission? It can't have been for nothing. That's why I had to prune you. Hunter D-90 to my office, immediately.
MOBIUS: Yeah. Sorry, Ravonna. That's not gonna work out the way you think it is, now that we know your secret. What did you do?
HUNTER U-92: Stay alert, she's close. Secure the perimeter. I've got her. Stand down, B-15. You need to listen to me.
HUNTER U-92: There'll be time for that. Just wait. What the hell is going on here? Judge Renslayer. What? Who are you? And what the hell are you doing in my school? That isn't Judge Renslayer. How? We have a lot to talk about.
HE WHO REMAINS: Been a long journey for you, hasn't it? Lot of running, lot of pain. And you... You're a flea on the back of a dragon. In for one hell of a ride. But you did manage to hang on. Mmm-hmm. I guess that counts for something. I'm not sure you quite understand the situation. You've lost. We found you. Duh. Of course you did. Whoa! A swing and a miss. So, we're still doing that, hmm? Let's get all this out of the way. Okay. Here we go. You can't kill me because I already know what's going to happen. See? It's a parlor trick. Okay. Don't you wonder how I'm able to get out of the way just before you kill me? No. It's because of that little TemPad you have there.
HE WHO REMAINS: Right. But how do I already have it loaded up with everything I need to know to keep from being killed by you two? It's easy. I know it all. And I've seen it all. Everything you guys did on Lamentis, I saw. All the stuff the TVA didn't know about, I knew. All the scheming, all the... ...talking. That little look by the lake. Quite sentimental, very touching stuff, by the way. No. No, we broke out of your little game. That's how we got here.
HE WHO REMAINS: No, wrong. Every step you took to get here, Lamentis, The Void, I paved the road. You... You just walked down it. And I have the rest, uh, right here. Everything that's, uh... that's going to happen. There's only one way this can go. Then why are we here?
HE WHO REMAINS: Oh, come on. You know you can't get to the end until you've been changed by the journey. This stuff, it needs to happen. To get us all in the right mindset to finish the quest. Right.
HE WHO REMAINS: Right. So, it's all a game. It's all... a manipulation.
HE WHO REMAINS: Interesting, that your head would go to that. Sylvie, you think you can trust this guy?
LOKI: Don't listen to him.
HE WHO REMAINS: "Don't listen to him." Do you think you're even capable of trusting anyone at all?
MOBIUS: I think people are ready to hear a little truth now. You know, like the TVA is a lie. But what if it's a necessary one? Someone created the Time-Keepers. They created this whole place. They gave us all purpose. I have to believe they had a reason.
MOBIUS: No, because I've seen the horror waiting for people when they get pruned and there's nothing necessary about that. You know what would happen if we didn't prune the Timeline?
MOBIUS: What? Chaos. Death.
MOBIUS: Free will? Free will? Only one person gets free will. The one in charge. "Friends across time, allies to the end." Shut up.
MOBIUS: That was so beautiful. And then you sent me to die. What happened to you? Nothing, Mobius. I didn't change.
MOBIUS: You didn't change? You betrayed me. No, no. You betrayed me! I looked out for you, hung my neck out for you, and you suffer a crisis of faith and turn to those Variants? Eons of friendship. And you threw it all away on a couple of Lokis. No, Mobius. I didn't betray you.
MOBIUS: We can't take away people's free will, Ravonna. Do you not see that? What are you doing? What I need to do.
MOBIUS: Wait, stop. Look, maybe we can build this into something better together. I'm sorry, Mobius.
MOBIUS: I'm not gonna let you go.
RENSLAYER: Please, Mobius. Even with that... you're of no danger to me.
MOBIUS: Is that what you think? Let's see.
MOBIUS: Yep, you were right. Back here again.
MOBIUS: Go ahead.
MOBIUS: Where are you gonna go? In search of free will.
HE WHO REMAINS: I understand your moral objections to what the TVA does. And my methods are deceptive. But the mission, it never was. Without the me, without the TVA... everything burns. Then what are you so afraid of?
HE WHO REMAINS: Me. And just who are you?
HE WHO REMAINS: Oh, I've been dubbed many names by many people. A ruler, a conqueror. He Who Remains, a jerk. But it's... it's not as simple as a name. Eons ago, before the TVA, a variant of myself lived on Earth in the 31st century. He was a scientist and he discovered that there were universes stacked on top of his own. At the same time, other versions of us were learning the same thing. Naturally, they made contact. And for a while, there was peace. Narcissistic, self-congratulatory peace. "I love your shoes." "I love your hair." "Oh, man, nice nose." "Thanks, man." Et cetera. They shared technology and knowledge. Using the best of their universes to improve the others. However... not every version of me was so... so pure of heart. To some of us, new worlds meant only one thing, new lands to be conquered. The peace between realities... ...erupted into all-out war, each variant fighting to preserve their universe and annihilate the others. This was almost the end... ...ladies and gentlemen, of everything and everyone. And then the Time-Keepers came along and saved us all.
HE WHO REMAINS:  Amen No.  No. Nope, this is where we diverge from the dogma. That first variant encountered a creature created from all the tears in reality, capable of consuming time and space itself. A creature... you both know.
LOKI: Alioth.
HE WHO REMAINS: Bingo! I harnessed the beast's power and began experimenting on it. I weaponized Alioth and I ended... I ended the Multiversal War. Once I isolated our timeline, all I had to do was manage the flow of time and prevent any further branches. Hence, the TVA. Hence, the Time-Keepers and a highly efficient bureaucracy. Hence, ages... ...and ages of cosmic harmony. Hence... you're welcome. You came to kill the devil, right? Well, guess what? I keep you safe. And if you think I'm evil, well, just wait till you meet my variants. And that's the gambit. Stifling order or cataclysmic chaos.
HE WHO REMAINS: You may hate the dictator, but something... ...far worse is gonna fill that void if you depose of him. I've lived a million lifetimes. I've gone through every scenario. This is the only way. The TVA, it works. Or you're a liar.
HE WHO REMAINS: Or I'm a liar. So you just... continue to prune innocent timelines?
HE WHO REMAINS: Mmm-mmm. You two would. There's two options! One... you kill me and destroy all this, so you don't just have one devil, you have an infinite amount. Or... you two. You two run the thing. You're lying. Why would you give up being in control?
HE WHO REMAINS: Buddy... I'm tired. And I'm older. I'm older than I look. This game is for the young, the hungry. I've gone through a lot of scenarios... trying to find the right person to take this spot. It turns out that person came in two. But it's definitely you two. So, no more lies. You kill me and the Sacred Timeline is completely exposed. Multiversal War. Or you take over and return to the TVA as its benevolent rulers. Tell the workforce who they are and why they do what they do. You treated real people's lives like some kind of game. It's not personal, it's practical.
SYLVIE: It was personal to me.
HE WHO REMAINS: Grow up! Grow up, Sylvie! Murderer! Hypocrite! We're all villains here. We've all done horrible, terrible, horrific things. But now, we, you... have a chance to do them for a good reason.
HE WHO REMAINS: We just crossed... the threshold.
HE WHO REMAINS: Oh. So, I fibbed. I fibbed earlier when I said I know how everything's going to go. I... I know... I knew... ...everything up to a certain point, and that point was about... seven, eight, nine, ten seconds ago. But now I have no idea. No idea how the rest of this is going to go. I'm being candid. So, that's it? That's it? This is what happens at the end of time? And now you're just gonna sit there with all that freedom and... let us decide your fate?
HE WHO REMAINS: Yes! Yes! Yes! What's the worst that can happen? You either... take over and my life's work continues or you plunge a blade in my chest and an infinite amount of me... start another Multiversal War. And I just... end up right back here anyways. Reincarnation, baby. No, it's just another lie. Another manipulation.
HE WHO REMAINS: Oh. No lie. No manipulation.
HE WHO REMAINS: Wow. I love this. I love... all this honesty. Feels like a fresh start. Oh, holy...
SYLVIE: What're you doing?
LOKI: Hang on a moment. Let's just talk about it.
SYLVIE: Well, how about we finish what we started and kill him?
LOKI: What if he's telling the truth? So what?
LOKI: I believe him.
SYLVIE: Believe what? That a bazillion boogeymen will turn up just because we give people free will? He's a liar, Loki.
LOKI: So am I. And I don't think he was lying. Not about that. Insane? Yes. But maybe he was telling the truth. Better hurry. Timeline's already branching. So, what are you suggesting?
LOKI: That we think about it.
SYLVIE: And what precisely is there to think about?
LOKI: Weren't you listening to what he was saying? That's the gambit. Remove the dictator and what fills the void?
SYLVIE: Ah. You want the throne?
LOKI: No, that's not it. No.
SYLVIE: I don't believe you.
LOKI: Sylvie, the universe is in the balance, everything we know to be true. Everything. I know the TVA has hurt us both. But what if by taking him out, we risk unleashing something even worse? All I'm suggesting is we just take a minute to think about it. I promise you from my heart this isn't about a throne.
SYLVIE: What was I thinking trusting you? Has this whole thing been a con?
LOKI: Really? That's what you think of me... after all this time? Sure. Why not? Evil Loki's master plan comes together. Well, you never trusted me, did you? What was the point?
LOKI: Can't you see? This is bigger than our experience.
SYLVIE: Why aren't we seeing this the same way?
LOKI: Because you can't trust... and I can't be trusted. Then I guess we're in a pickle.
LOKI: Sylvie, wait. Wait.
LOKI: Sylvie. Sylvie.
LOKI: Maybe he's lying! Maybe he's not. The cost of getting this wrong is too great. Fine. Do it. Kill me. Take your throne.
LOKI: No.
LOKI: Sylvie, stop. Stop.
LOKI: Stop.
LOKI: Stop.
LOKI: I've been where you are. I've felt what you feel. Don't ask me how I know. All I know... is I don't wanna hurt you. I don't want a throne. I just... I just want you to be okay. But I'm not you.
HE WHO REMAINS: Incredible.
SYLVIE: Aren't you gonna beg for your life?
HE WHO REMAINS: Um, could, could.
HE WHO REMAINS: I'll see you soon.
MOBIUS: No turning back now. Who said anything about turning back? "For all time." "Always."
MAN: Copy. Reporting to the armory, sir. That's, what, 63 new branches in this unit alone? Does he want us to just let them all branch? At this point, how are we gonna stop it?
LOKI: We can't! What? What'd you say?
LOKI: It's done, Mobius. We made a terrible mistake. What's done? What?
LOKI: We freed the Timeline. We found him beyond the storm. A Citadel at the End of Time. He's terrifying. He planned everything. He's seen everything. He knows everything. It's complicated. Okay? Right.
LOKI: But someone is coming. Countless different versions of a very dangerous person. And they're all set on war. We need to prepare. Take it easy. You're an analyst, right? What division are you from?
LOKI: What? What are you talking about?
MOBIUS: Who are you? What's your name? Boots on the ground now. Archives. Who are you?
