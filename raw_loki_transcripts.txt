== New York City 2012 ==
'''STEVE ROGERS:''' On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

'''LOKI:''' [''Transformed into Steve Rogers, mocking.''] "On my way down to coordinate search and rescue." [''Transforms back into himself.''] I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?

[''Thor puts a gag on Loki.'']

'''THOR:''' Shut up.

[''Everyone gets into the elevator, Tony carrying the Tesseract in a case, and Hulk makes to follow.'']

'''TONY STARK:''' Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Hey, hey. Buddy!

'''TONY STARK:''' What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.

[''Hulk growls. Loki waves.'']

'''THOR:''' Take the stairs.

'''TONY STARK:''' Yeah. Stop, stop.

[''Loud thud and Hulk growls as the elevator doors close.'']

[''On the ground floor.'']

'''AGENT:''' Hand over the case, Stark. Hand it over.

[''The Agents and Stark struggle for the case. It falls to the ground. 2023 Ant-Man kicks it so it slides away.'']

'''PIERCE:''' Stark?

'''THOR:''' Stark?

Breathe, breathe.

[''Tony Stark from 2023 picks up the case and begins walking to the stairs.'']

'''2023 TONY STARK:''' Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

[''Hulk slams out of the stairs, knocking down 2023 Tony, the case falls and opens, the Tesseract slides across the floor to Loki's foot.'']

'''HULK:''' No stairs!

[''People run and scream. Hulk roars. Loki picks up the Tesseract and transports away. Screen goes black.'']

'''THOR:''' Where's Loki? Loki! Loki!

[''Marvel Studios logo.'']

== Gobi Desert, Mongolia 2012 ==

[''A portal opens and Loki falls through to the ground. He groans and gets up. At seeing people approach, he quickly stands on rocks above them.'']

'''LOKI:''' I am Loki of Asgard.
And I am burdened with glorious purpose.

'''WOMAN:''' [''In Mongolian''] ''Who are you? Why have you come to our home?''

'''LOKI:''' [''In English''] I...

[''A Timedoor opens and several Miuntemen come through.'']

'''LOKI:''' Never mind. [''To the Minutemen, referring to the Tesseract.'']
Don't touch that.

[''Another Timedoor opens and Hunter B-15 steps through.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Appears to be
a standard sequence violation.
Branch is growing
at a stable rate and slope.
Variant identified.

'''LOKI:''' I beg your pardon.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' On behalf of the Time Variance Authority,
I hereby arrest you
for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.
Hands up.

[''Weapons power up.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' You're coming with us.

'''LOKI:''' I'm sorry. Who's "us"?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Last chance, Variant.

'''LOKI:''' [''Chuckles.''] It's been a very long day,
and I think I've had my fill of idiots
in armored suits telling me what to do,
so, if you don't mind,
this is actually your last chance.
Now get out of my way.

[''Hunter B-15 strikes him with her weapons. He falls back in slow motion. Hunter-B15 approaches and places a collar on Loki.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' You are now moving at 1/16th speed,
but feeling all that pain in real time.

[''Loki falls to the ground, returning to moving in real time.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Reset the timeline.

[''A Reset Charge is placed and activated. Loki is pulled through the Timedoor.'']

== TVA ==
=== Evidence log room ===
'''MAN 1:''' What species?

'''MAN 2:''' Variant Skrull.

'''LOKI:''' What is this place?

'''MARTIN:''' My dad is on the board of Goldman Sachs.
One little call and your whole job is privatized.
Your little job.

'''MAN 3:''' All right.

'''MARTIN:''' Your little job, how'd you like that?

'''MAN 1:''' Hello, sir.

[''Loki tries to run, but Hunter B-15 uses the Time Twister to pull him back.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Come on.

'''LOKI:''' You're making a terrible mistake.

'''MARTIN:''' You're making a big mistake. Whoa whoa whoa!

'''CASEY:''' Hello, ma'am, uh...

[''Hunter B-15 places the Tesseract on the counter.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Log this as evidence.

'''CASEY:''' Oh... Can you at least tell me what it is?

'''LOKI:''' It's the Tesseract.
Be very careful with it.

'''CASEY:''' It sounds dumb.

'''LOKI:''' Know this.
You cross me,
there are deadly consequences.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' We'll see.

[''Hunter B-15 pushes Loki into a room.''] 

=== Clothes room ===
[''The door closes behind him. A machine begins to pluck at Loki's clothes.'']

'''LOKI:''' Hey, hey!
Absolutely not.
This is fine Asgardian leather.

'''MACHINE:''' Hold very still.

[''The machine zaps off Loki's clothes, leaving him naked.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''Stuttering''] Now, hang on just a minute.

[''A door open beneath Loki's feet and he falls through.'']

=== Paperwork room ===
[''Loki screams as he falls into an office room, newly dressed in TVA processing clothes. A cat purrs in the corner.'']

'''PAPERWORK CLERK:''' Please sign to verify
this is everything you've ever said.

'''LOKI:''' What?

[''Printer whirs as it prints another page. Paperwork Clerk adds it to the pile.'']

'''PAPERWORK CLERK:''' Sign this, too.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, this is absurd.

[''Printer whirs as it prints another page. Paperwork Clerk adds it to the pile.'']

'''PAPERWORK CLERK:''' And this.

[''Loki sighs and signs his name. Again a door opens beneath him and he falls into the next room.'']

=== Scanning room ===
'''SCANNER CLERK:'''
Please confirm to your knowledge
that you are not a fully robotic being,
were born an organic creature,
and do in fact possess
what many cultures would call a soul.

'''LOKI:''' 
What? "To my knowledge"?
Do a lot of people not know
if they're robots?

'''SCANNER CLERK:''' 
Thank you for your confirmation. Please move through.

[''Machine energy pulsates.'']

'''LOKI:''' What if I was a robot
and I didn't know it?

'''SCANNER CLERK:''' 
The machine would melt you
from the inside out.
Please move along, sir.

'''LOKI:''' Okay, I'm not a robot, so I'll be fine.

[''Loki steps through. The machine hums with energy and a bright light flashes.'']

'''LOKI:''' What?

[''The machine prints out an image.'']

'''LOKI:''' Oh, what's that?

'''SCANNER CLERK:''' Your temporal aura.

'''LOKI:''' What's ''that''?

'''SCANNER CLERK:''' Please, through the door.

=== Ticket room ===
'''MINUTEMAN:''' Take a ticket.

'''MARTIN:''' What is this, a deli? No.

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Take a ticket.

'''LOKI:''' There's only two of us in here.

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Take a ticket.

[''Loki takes a ticket begins walking through the empty line.'']

'''LOKI:''' This is a mistake! I shouldn't be here!

'''MISS MINUTES:''' [''On TV video presentation.'']
Hey there! You're probably saying,
"This is a mistake.
I shouldn't even be here."
Welcome to the Time Variance Authority.
I'm Miss Minutes,
and it's my job to catch you up
before you stand trial for your crimes.
So let's not waste another minute.
Settle in, sharpen your pencils,
and check this out.

(THUNDERCLAP)

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Long ago, there was
a vast multiversal war.
Countless unique timelines
battled each other for supremacy,
nearly resulting
in the total destruction of...

(EXPLOSION)

'''MISS MINUTES:''' ...well, everything.
But then, the all-knowing
Time-Keepers emerged,
bringing peace by reorganizing
the multiverse into a single timeline,
the Sacred Timeline.
Now, the Time-Keepers protect and preserve
the proper flow of time
for everyone and everything.
But sometimes, people like you veer off
the path the Time-Keepers created.
We call those Variants.
Maybe you started an uprising,
or were just late for work.
Whatever it was, stepping off your path
created a nexus event,
which, left unchecked,
could branch off into madness,
leading to another multiversal war.

(BEEPING)

'''MISS MINUTES:''' But, don't worry,
to make sure that doesn't happen,
the Time-Keepers created
the TVA and all its incredible workers.

(BEEPING)

'''MISS MINUTES:''' The TVA has stepped in to fix your mistake
and set time back
on its predetermined path.
Now that your actions have left you
without a place on the timeline,
you must stand trial for your offenses.
So sit tight, and we'll get you
in front of a judge in no time.
Just make sure you have your ticket,
and you'll be seen
by the next available attendant.
For all time.

'''ONSCREEN GROUP VOICES:''' Always.

'''LOKI:''' [''Scoffs'']
Time-Keepers? The Sacred Timeline?
Who actually believes this bunkum?

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Ticket, sir?

'''MARTIN:''' The guy didn't give me a ticket. I tried to ask for one.

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Ticket, sir!

'''MARTIN:''' I tried to ask that guy for a ticket!

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Sir...

'''MARTIN:''' What, you're raising
your voice at me, bucket head?

[''Martin screams as he's pruned. Loki shudders in surprise.'']

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Thanks for visiting the TVA.
Don't hesitate
to let us know how we're doing.

[''Opening theme.'']

== Aix-En-Provence, France 1549 ==
'''MINUTEMAN:''' The hunter and his Minutemen
responded to a routine nexus event.
It appears that when they arrived,
somebody got the jump on 'em.

'''MOBIUS:''' You think?

'''HUNTER U-92:''' It's him.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah, stab wounds look
consistent with the others.
Positioning of the bodies indicates
they didn't know what the hell hit 'em.
And reset charge is gone.

'''HUNTER U-92:''' That's the sixth attack in the last week.

'''MOBIUS:''' That we know of.

[''Clatter in the back when a young boy enters.'']

'''HUNTER U-92:''' Hey!

'''MOBIUS:''' Wait, stand down! Stand down.
It's just a kid.
[''In French''] ''I'm sorry... my friend is an imbecile.''

'''HUNTER U-92:''' Hey, yo! [''In French''] ''I speak every language on the timeline too. Jackass.''

[''Mobius pulls out a device, draws a stick figure on it, and hands it to the boy.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' [''In English''] Tap it.

[''The boy does so. The stick figure animates, and the boy smiles.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' [''In French''] ''Do you know who did this?''

[''The boy points to a stained glass window depicting the devil.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' [''In English''] Don't worry,
that devil's afraid of us.
We're gonna take care of him.
And we're gonna put you
back where you belong.

[''Mobius tabs the boy on the chest, and he smiles, revealing blue around his lips and teeth.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' [''In French''] ''That blue... What is that?''

[''The boy hands him a stick of "Blooberrie"-flavored Kablooie gum.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' [''In English''] Devil bearing gifts. 
[''Hands it to Hunter U-92.'']
Go ahead and run this for sequence period
and any hints of temporal aura.

'''HUNTER U-92:''' You know we won't get anything.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah, just give it a shot.

'''HUNTER U-92:''' The branch
is nearing red line. We need to go.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay. [''In French''] ''Go wait outside.'' [''In English''] It's okay.

'''HUNTER U-92:''' Set a reset charge.

[''Another door appears and a man steps through.'']

'''MAN:''' Sir, there's something you'll wanna see.

[''He hands Mobius the files on Loki.'']

== TVA ==
=== Courtroom ===
[''Gavel bangs. Hunter B-15 escorts Loki into the courtroom.'']

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' Next case, please.
Laufeyson. Variant L1130,
AKA Loki Laufeyson,
is charged with
sequence violation 7-20-89.
How do you plead?

'''LOKI:''' [''Chuckles.'']
Madam, a god doesn't plead.
This has been a very enjoyable pantomime,
but I'd like to go home now.

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' Are you guilty or not guilty, sir?

'''LOKI:''' [''Scoffs.''] Guilty of being
the God of Mischief? Yes.
Guilty of finding
all this incredibly tedious? Yes.
Guilty of a crime
against the Sacred Timeline?
Absolutely not, you have the wrong person.

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' Oh, really? And who should we have?

'''LOKI:''' I suspect, the Avengers.
I came into possession of the Tesseract
because they traveled through time,
no doubt in a last-ditch effort
to stave off my ascent to God King.

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' That's quite an accusation.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, believe me, you can smell
the cologne of two Tony Starks.
You speak of Time Criminals?
It's they you should be after.
Perhaps you could provide me
with a taskforce and resources,
and I could return
and eliminate them for you.

[''Mobius enters the courtroom and takes a seat.'']

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' We're not here to talk about the Avengers.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, no?

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' No.
What they did was supposed to happen.
You escaping was not.

'''LOKI:''' [''Laughs.'']
Right. Uh...
"Not supposed to happen"?
According to whom?

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' The Time-Keepers?

'''LOKI:''' Oh, the Time-Keepers. Right.
Well, perhaps I should speak
to these Time-Keepers, gods to gods.

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' I'm sorry, but they're quite busy.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, they are? What are they doing?

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' Dictating the proper flow of time.

'''LOKI:''' I see. Right. And then what do you do?

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' Dictate the proper flow of time
according to their dictations.
How do you plead?

'''LOKI:''' Guilty... of this.

[''Stifled laughter from the room.'']

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' What's going on?

'''LOKI:''' Hang on. Everyone quiet.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' [''Chuckles.''] He's trying to use his powers, ma'am.

'''LOKI:''' Don't rush me. [''Grunts as he tries again.'']
Damn it! Why won't it work?

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' Magic powers?
They're no good in the TVA, Mr. Laufeyson.
The court finds you guilty,
and I sentence you to be reset. [''Bangs gavel.'']
Next case, please!

'''LOKI:''' "Reset"? What does that mean?
What, is it bad? What does it mean?
Hey! You ridiculous bureaucrats
will not dictate how my story ends!

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' It's not your story, Mr. Laufeyson.
It never was.

'''LOKI:''' 
You have no idea what I'm capable of!

'''MOBIUS:''' I... I think I might.
Have an idea of what he's capable of.

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' Approach the bench.

[''Mobius does so and they speak softly.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Hi.

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' If you're thinking what I think you are,
it's a bad idea.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, I'm just chasing a hunch.

'''JUDGE RENSLAYER:''' Anything goes sideways, it's on you.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay. I feel like
I'm always looking up to you.
I like it. It's appropriate.

'''LOKI:''' And who are you?

=== Hallway ===
'''LOKI:''' I'm gonna burn this place to the ground.

'''MOBIUS:''' I'll show you where my desk is,
you can start there.

[''Loki pauses as he sees the city through a window.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Have a look. Home sweet home.

'''LOKI:''' I thought there was no magic here.

'''MOBIUS:''' There isn't.

'''LOKI:''' That's not real.

'''MOBIUS:''' It is, and, unfortunately,
so is all the paperwork.
Good tinder for your fire, though.
Come on.

'''LOKI:''' This place is a nightmare.

'''MOBIUS:''' That's another department.
Now that department
I'll help you burn down.

[''Loki sighs.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.

'''LOKI:''' Are you taking me somewhere to kill me?

'''MOBIUS:''' No. That's where you just were.
I'm taking you some place to talk.

'''LOKI:''' I don't like to talk.

'''MOBIUS:''' But you do like to lie,
which you just did.
Because we both know you love to talk.
Talkie-talkie.

'''LOKI:''' How long have you been here?

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Sighs.''] I don't know. It's hard to say,
time passes differently here in the TVA.

'''LOKI:''' What does that mean?

'''MOBIUS:''' You'll catch up.

'''LOKI:''' So, you're part of the TVA's
courageous and dedicated workforce?

'''MOBIUS:''' Yes.

'''LOKI:''' You were created by the Time-Keepers.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yep.

'''LOKI:''' To protect the Sacred Timeline.

'''MOBIUS:''' Correct.

[''Loki laughs.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Is that funny?

'''LOKI:''' The idea that your little club
decides the fate of trillions of people
across all of existence
at the behest of three space lizards,
yes, it's funny.
It's absurd.

'''MOBIUS:''' I thought you didn't like to talk.

[''Scoffs'']

[''Sighs'']

'''MOBIUS:''' After you.

=== Time Theater 5 ===
'''LOKI:''' For the record, this really does feel
like a killing-me kind of a room.

'''MOBIUS:''' Not big on trust, are you?

'''LOKI:''' Trust is for children and dogs.
There's only one person you can trust.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yourself? I like it.
Slap it on a T-shirt.

'''LOKI:''' If the TVA truly oversees all of time,
how have I never heard of you until now?

'''MOBIUS:''' 'Cause you've never needed to.
You've always lived within your set path.

'''LOKI:''' I live within whatever path I choose.

'''MOBIUS:''' Sure you do. Okay, come have a seat.

'''MOBIUS:''' I told you, time moves differently in the TVA. Come on, sit down. Let's get into this. Go on, have a seat.

'''MOBIUS:''' If looks could kill.

'''LOKI:''' What do you want from me?

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Inhales.''] Well, let's start
with a little cooperation.

'''LOKI:''' Not my forte.

'''MOBIUS:''' Really?
Even when you're wooing
someone powerful you intend to betray?
Come on.

'''LOKI:''' You don't know anything about me.

'''MOBIUS:''' Maybe I'd like to learn.
I specialize in the pursuit
of dangerous Variants.

'''LOKI:''' Like myself?

'''MOBIUS:''' Mmm...
No, particularly dangerous Variants.
You're just a little pussycat.
I got a set of questions for you.
You answer them honestly,
and then maybe
I can give you something you want.
You wanna get out of here, right?
Yeah, so we'll start there.
Should you return, what are you gonna do?

'''LOKI:''' Finish what I started.

'''MOBIUS:''' Which is?

'''LOKI:''' Claim my throne.

'''MOBIUS:''' You wanna be king?

'''LOKI:''' I don't want to be, I was born to be.

'''MOBIUS:''' I know, but king of what exactly?

'''LOKI:''' [''Scoffs'']
You wouldn't understand.

'''MOBIUS:''' Try me.

'''LOKI:''' Midgard.

'''MOBIUS:''' AKA Earth.
All right. Now you're the king of Midgard,
then what?
Happily ever after?

'''LOKI:''' Asgard, the Nine Realms.

'''MOBIUS:''' Space?

'''LOKI:''' Space.

'''MOBIUS:''' Space is big.
That'd be a nice feather in your cap.
"Loki, the King of Space."

'''LOKI:''' Mock me if you dare.

'''MOBIUS:''' No, I'm not. [''Chuckles'']
Honestly, I'm actually a fan. Yeah.
And I guess I'm wondering why does someone
with so much range just wanna rule?

'''LOKI:''' I would've made it easy for them.

'''MOBIUS:''' People like easy.

'''LOKI:''' The first
and most oppressive lie ever uttered
was the song of freedom.

'''MOBIUS:''' How's that one go?

'''LOKI:''' For nearly every living thing,
choice breeds shame
and uncertainty and regret.
There's a fork in every road,
yet the wrong path always taken.

'''MOBIUS:''' Good. Yeah.
You said "nearly every living thing,"
so I'm guessing
you don't fall into that category?

'''LOKI:''' [''Chuckles'']
[''Sighs'']
The Time-Keepers
have built quite the circus,
and I see the clowns are playing
their parts to perfection.

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Chuckles'']
Big metaphor guy. I love it.
Makes you sound super smart.

'''LOKI:''' I am smart.

'''MOBIUS:''' I know.
Okay.
Okay.

[''A video starts onscreen.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''Scoffs''] What is this?

'''MOBIUS:''' A sampling of your greatest hits,
if I may.

[''Loki sighs.'']

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' If it's all the same to you...
I'll have that drink now.

[''Mobius offers Loki a drink.'']

'''LOKI:''' No.
And I remember. I was there.
Anything else?

'''MOBIUS:''' It's funny, for someone born to rule,
you sure do lose a lot.
You might even say it's in your nature.

'''LOKI:''' You know, things didn't turn out so well
for the last person who said that to me.

'''MOBIUS:''' Oh, yeah, Phil Coulson.

[''Onscreen, Loki stabs Coulson.'']

'''ONSCREEN THOR:''' No!

'''MOBIUS:''' Didn't the Avengers come together
to literally avenge him by defeating you?

'''LOKI:''' Little solace to a dead man.

'''MOBIUS:''' Do you enjoy hurting people?
Making them feel small?
Making them feel afraid?

'''LOKI:''' Your games don't frighten me.

'''MOBIUS:''' Making them feel little?

'''LOKI:''' I know what I am.

'''MOBIUS:''' A murderer?

'''LOKI:''' A liberator.

'''MOBIUS:''' Of eyeballs, maybe.

[''A man onscreen screams as Loki stabs a device over his eye as part of Loki's attack on Midgard.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Look at that smile.
You are enjoying that.
Did you enjoy hurting them?

'''LOKI:''' I don't have to play this game. I'm a god.

'''MOBIUS:''' Of what, again? Mischief, right?

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah. I don't see anything
very mischievous about this.

'''LOKI:''' No, I don't suppose you do.

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Sighs.''] Let's talk about your escapes.
You're really good at doing awful things,
and then just getting away.

'''LOKI:''' What can I say? I'm a mischievous scamp.

'''MOBIUS:''' This is one of my favorites.

'''CAPTAIN:''' [''Over PA.''] From the flight deck,
Captain William A. Scott,
Northwest Orient Airlines 305,
on schedule to land in Seattle.
Flight time today, approximately...

'''FLIGHT ATTENDANT:''' Bourbon and soda?

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' Thank you.

'''FLIGHT ATTENDANT:''' Absolutely.
Is there anything else
I can do for you, sir?

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' I suppose we'll find out, won't we?

[''Chuckles'']

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' Uh, Miss?

'''FLIGHT ATTENDANT:''' Yes, Mr. Cooper?

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' You might want to take a look
at that note. [''Whispers''] I have a bomb.

'''LOKI:''' I fail to see how this has
any relevance or bearing on...

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Shushes''] No. This is the good part.

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' See you again someday.
Brother,
Heimdall, you better be ready.

'''MOBIUS:''' I can't believe you were D.B. Cooper.
Come on!

'''LOKI:''' I was young, and I lost a bet to Thor.
Where was the TVA when I was meddling
with these affairs of men?

'''MOBIUS:''' We were right there with you,
just surfing that Sacred Timeline.

'''LOKI:''' So that had the Time-Keepers'
seal of approval, did it?

'''MOBIUS:''' Well, I wouldn't think of it
in terms of approval and disapproval.
That's sort of a...
Let's get back to escapes...

'''LOKI:''' [''Sighs'']

'''MOBIUS:''' ...and a little psychobabble.
What is it that you think
that you're really running from?

'''LOKI:''' Enough.

[''Loki stands up. Mobius uses the Time Twister to return Loki to his seat.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Back in your cage.
See, I can play the heavy keys, too.

'''LOKI:''' I was just standing up to make a point.

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Chuckles''] I'm sorry, go ahead.

'''LOKI:''' It won't be as meaningful now.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, well, stay seated.

'''LOKI:''' I'll do what I want to do!

'''MOBIUS:''' Sure.

'''LOKI:''' [''Sighs'']
What exactly is it that you want?

'''MOBIUS:''' I want you to be honest
about why you do what you do.

'''LOKI:''' Liar.

'''MOBIUS:''' I'm serious.
All I seek is a deeper understanding
of the fearsome God of Mischief.

[''Loki scoffs.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' What makes Loki tick?

'''LOKI:''' I know what this place is.

'''MOBIUS:''' What is it?

'''LOKI:''' It's an illusion.
It's a cruel, elaborate trick
conjured by the weak to inspire fear.
A desperate attempt at control.
Now, you all parade about
as if you're the divine arbiters
of power in the universe.

'''MOBIUS:''' We are.

'''LOKI:''' You're not.
My choices are my own.

'''MOBIUS:''' Your choice is your own.
Good, let's go with that.
I think this one's gonna fire you up.

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy
in a mad scramble for power...

'''LOKI:''' Precisely.
I was...
I am on the verge of acquiring
everything I am owed,
and when I do, it'll be because I did it.
Not because it was supposed to happen.
Or because you
or the Time Variance Authority,
or whatever it is you call yourselves,
allowed me to.
Honestly, you're pathetic.
You're an irrelevance.
A detour.
A footnote to my ascent.

'''MOBIUS:''' You finished?
You're gonna start
taking things seriously.

[''Loki groans.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' If you hadn't picked up the Tesseract,
you would have been
taken to a cell on Asgard.

[''Onscreen, Loki walks in chains.'']

'''ONSCREEN FRIGGA:''' Loki.

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' Hello, Mother.
Have I made you proud?

'''ONSCREEN FRIGGA:''' Please don't make this worse.

'''LOKI:''' What is this?
This is nonsense, more tricks.
This never even happened.

'''MOBIUS:''' Not to you.
Not yet.
Look, the TVA doesn't just know
your whole past,
we know your whole life,
how it's all meant to be.
Think of it as comforting.

'''LOKI:''' This is absurd.

'''ONSCREEN FRIGGA:''' And am I not your mother?

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' You're not.

'''ONSCREEN FRIGGA:''' Hmm.
Always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.

'''MOBIUS:''' And then the Dark Elves
attack the palace,
and you think you send them to Thor.

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' You might wanna
take the stairs to the left.

'''MOBIUS:''' But instead, you send them...

'''ONSCREEN FRIGGA:''' I'll never tell.

[''Frigga groans as she's stabbed with a sword.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''Breath shudders.'']
Where do you have her? Where is she?

'''MOBIUS:''' You lead them right to her.

'''LOKI:''' I don't believe you.
You're lying. It's not true.

'''MOBIUS:''' It is true.
That's the proper flow of time,
and it happens again and again and again
because it's supposed to,
because it has to.

'''MOBIUS:''' The TVA makes sure of it.

'''LOKI:''' Where is she?

'''MOBIUS:''' Now why don't you tell me,
do you enjoy hurting people?

'''LOKI:''' I don't believe you.

'''MOBIUS:''' Do you enjoy killing?

'''LOKI:''' I'll kill you.

'''MOBIUS:''' What, like you did your mother?

[''Loki throws a chair at Mobius, who stpes out of the way. The chair goes through the screen; the image is disrupted but returns. Mobius uses the Time Twister and Loki is returned to where he was seated, but with no chair there he drops to the floor.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Sorry, the Time Twister just loops you,
not the furniture.
You weren't born to be king, Loki.
You were born to cause
pain and suffering and death.
That's how it is, that's how it was,
that's how it will be.
All so that others can achieve
their best versions of themselves.

[''The Chitauri onscreen screech. Mobius offers Loki a hand.'']

'''LOKI:''' What is this place?

'''MOBIUS:''' Come on.

[''Loki takes Mobius's hand and gets up. The door opens.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' What are you doing?

'''MOBIUS:''' My job. Is it yours to interrupt?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' We have a situation.

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Sighs''] There's always a situation.
Don't go anywhere.
It was just getting good. Spirited.
[''Sighs'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Talking to that Variant is a mistake.

'''MOBIUS:''' That's your position. I think the opposite.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' He should be reset!

'''MOBIUS:''' You think everyone should be reset.
I'm getting good stuff in there!

'''HUNTER B-15:''' We just lost another unit.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, Loki, I think we can
finish up tomorrow and just pick it...

[''Mobius looks around the empty room. Checks pockets. Realizes the Time Twister is gone.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Mischievous scamp.

=== The chase ===
[''Loki sees Casey and follows after.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Wish I could say I was surprised.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah, I wish you hadn't interrupted us.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Me? It's my fault?

'''MOBIUS:''' Look, he can't have gotten very far.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Split up. Prune on sight.

'''MOBIUS:''' No, no pruning, no resetting.
He can still help us!

=== Casey's desk ===

'''LOKI:''' [''Whispers''] Hey.

'''CASEY:''' Hey. I know you.

'''CASEY:''' You're that criminal with the blue box.

[''Loki shushes him and pulls him down to hide behind the desk.'']

'''CASEY:''' [''Whispers''] Ow.

'''LOKI:''' What's your name?

'''CASEY:''' Casey.

'''LOKI:''' Give me the Tesseract,
or I'll gut you like a fish, Casey.

'''CASEY:''' What's a fish?

[''Loki shushes him.'']

'''CASEY:''' [''Whispers''] What's a fish?

'''LOKI:''' How do you not know what a fish is?

'''CASEY:''' I've lived my entire life behind a desk.

'''LOKI:''' Well, what difference does it make?

'''CASEY:''' I wanna know exactly what I'm being
threatened with before I comply.

'''LOKI:''' Death, Casey. Violent, painful death.

'''CASEY:''' Okay, okay. I comply, I comply.
I comply. Jeez!

'''CASEY:''' Um... Oh.

'''CASEY:''' This it?

'''LOKI:''' What?
Infinity Stones?
How...
How do you have these?

'''CASEY:''' Oh, we actually get a lot of those.
Yeah. Some of the guys
use them as paperweights.
Some of 'em.

'''LOKI:''' Is this the greatest power
in the universe?

[''The elevator door opens. Hunter B-15 enters and swings the pruning stick. Loki uses the Time Twister to get himself away. The pruning weapon strikes Casey's cart, disintegrating it.'']

'''CASEY:''' Oh, you almost hit me!
That is so messed up.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Split up.
Check the lower concourse.

'''CASEY:''' I do not forgive you.

=== Time Theater 5 ===
[''Loki lands back in Time Theater 5. He resumes watching the video, going to Frigga's death, and looking forward.'']

'''ONSCREEN ODIN:''' I love you, my sons.
Remember this place.
Home.

[''Loki breathes deeply.'']

'''ONSCREEN THOR:''' Loki, I thought the world of you.
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.

[''Fast-forward.'']

'''ONSCREEN THOR:''' Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' Maybe not.

'''ONSCREEN THOR:''' Thank you.
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.

[''Loki chuckles'']

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' I'm here.

[''Fast-forward.'']

'''ONSCREEN THANOS:''' Undying?
You should choose
your words more carefully.

[''Onscreen, Thanos chokes Loki.'']

'''ONSCREEN LOKI:''' [''Straining''] You... will never be... a god.

[''Loki gasps as he watches Thanos snaps his neck onscreen. He continues watching as Thor holds his body and the ''Statesman'' explodes. The tape ends and the screen goes blank. Loki scoffs and then begins to laugh. The door opens behind him and Hunter B-15 enters.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' What's so funny?

'''LOKI:''' Glorious purpose.

[''They fight. Loki uses the Time Twister device to remove his collar and puts it on Hunter B-15. He uses the Time Twister to rewind her out of the room. He sighs. Experimentally, he then winds her back into the room, and away again. He then goes back and forth, winding her in and away.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Stop...
It.
Stop it!
St... Stop it...
It... Stop it...
Stop... I... St... Sto... St...

[''Loki rewinds her away and drops the Time Twister on the table.'']

=== Hallway ===
'''CASEY:''' And this guy kept saying
he was gonna turn me into a fish,
whatever that is,
and then they show up
and just prune my cart,
so there was nothing I could have done.

[''Hunter-B15 appears before them.'']

'''CASEY:''' [''Gasps'']
Hey, there you are.
You know, that Variant you had got away.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' [''Sighs'']

=== Time Theater 5 ===
[''Loki sighs and sits down. The door open and closes.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Loki?
Nowhere left to run.

'''LOKI:''' I can't go back, can I?
Back to my timeline.
I don't enjoy hurting people.
I... [''Sighs.'']
I don't enjoy it.
I do it because I have to,
because I've had to.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, explain that to me.

'''LOKI:''' Because it's part of the illusion.
It's the cruel, elaborate trick
conjured by the weak to inspire fear.

'''MOBIUS:''' "A desperate play for control." You do know yourself.

'''LOKI:''' A villain. [''Sighs.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' That's not how I see it.

[''Loki picks up the tesseract.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' You try to use that?

'''LOKI:''' Oh, several times. Even an Infinity Stone is useless here. [''Scoffs.''] The TVA is formidable.

'''MOBIUS:''' That's been my experience.
Listen, I can't offer you salvation,
but maybe I can offer you
something better.
A fugitive Variant's been killing
our Minutemen.

[''Loki stands up.'']

'''LOKI:''' And you need the God of Mischief to help you stop him?

'''MOBIUS:''' That's right.

'''LOKI:''' Why me?

'''MOBIUS:''' The Variant we're hunting is... you.

'''LOKI:''' I beg your pardon?

== Salina, Oklahoma 1858 ==
[''Hunter U-92 and three Minutemen arrive. A Minuteman scans a device.'']

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Time signature is early third millennium. Definitely anachronistic.

[''Hunter U-92 checks the ground.'']

'''HUNTER U-92:''' Oil. I think some jackass found himself a time machine, came back here to get rich.

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Should we fan out and look for him, sir?

'''HUNTER U-92:''' Nah. It's not worth the paperwork. Just prune it. Let's bail. Set a charge.

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Wait. Someone's out there.

[''A hooded figure stands in the distance.'']

'''HUNTER U-92:''' Check it out.

[''They power up their weapons and head toward the figure. The hooded figure raises a lantern and drops it. It breaks, igniting the oil. The fire rushes toward Hunter U-92 and the Minutemen.'']

'''HUNTER U-92:''' Get down!

[''The Minutemen scream as the fire catches them. Hunter U-92 falls to the ground, fire around him. He crawls toward the reset charge, but is pulled back, screaming, before he can get to it. The hooded figure picks up the reset charge.'']

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Thanks for visiting the TVA. Don't hesitate to let us know how we're doing.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' On behalf
of the Time Variance Authority,
I hereby arrest you
for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Long ago, the all-knowing
Time-Keepers emerged,
creating and organizing
the Sacred Timeline.
Sometimes, people like you
veer off the path.
We call those Variants.

[''Martin screams as he's pruned.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Laufeyson, how do you plead?

'''MOBIUS:''' I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.

'''LOKI:''' How long have you been here?

'''MOBIUS:''' I don't know. It's hard to say, you know, time passes differently here in the TVA.

'''LOKI:''' Now, you parade about
as if you're the divine arbiters
of power in the universe.

'''LOKI:''' Infinity Stones?

'''CASEY:''' Some of the guys
use 'em as paperweights.

'''LOKI:''' 
Is this the greatest power
in the universe?

[''Loki gasps as he watches the video of Thanos killing him.'']

'''LOKI:''' I can't go back, can I?

'''MOBIUS:''' I can't offer you salvation,
but maybe I can offer
you something better.
A fugitive Variant's been killing

'''LOKI:''' And you need the God of Mischief
to help you stop him?
Why me?

You.

[''Renaissance Faire with music playing. Indistinct chatter.'']

'''CHILD:''' Make a wish.

[''Hunter C-20 and three Minutemen arrive.'']

'''REN FAIRE WOMAN:''' Hi! What's going on?
You guys aren't dressed right.
[''Chuckles.''] I... So...

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Variant detected, Commander.

'''HUNTER C-20:''' Let's move.

'''REN FAIRE WOMAN:''' Some of us need this, you know.

[''Hunter C-20 and Minutemen enter a tent.'']

'''MINUTEMAN:''' No nexus energy yet, ma'am.

[''Music blares over the speakers.'']

'''HUNTER C-20:''' It's a trap.
Watch your backs!

'''ANNOUNCER:''' My lords, my ladies, welcome
and thank you for joining us,
here at the castle.
Please, settle into your seats
for a great battle is about to commence.
The prize? Our princess.
Will evil prevail,
or are we holding out for a hero?

[''"Holding Out For A Hero" by Bonnie Tyler begins playing. Hunter C-20 puts her back to a post. A hand reaches around and touches her temple with green magic. Green flashes in her eyes and she begins attacking the Minutemen.'']

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Commander?

'''MUSIC:''' Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the Gods?
Where's the streetwise
Hercules to fight...

'''MINUTEMAN:''' What are you doing?

'''THE VARIANT / HUNTER C-20:''' Having some fun.

'''MUSIC:''' 
Isn't there a white knight
Upon a fiery steed?

[''Hunter C-20 collapses. The Minuteman checks on her. A cloaked figure steps out.'']

'''MUSIC:'''
Late at night, I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero
Till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

[''Minuteman attacks the figure, who attacks him with a sword, killing him. The figure takes the reset charges and uses a Tempad to open a Timedoor. The figure drags Hunter C-20, who's still unconscious through the Timedoor.'']

'''MUSIC:'''
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero
'Till the morning light
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
I need a hero!

[''The Timedoor closes behind them.'']]

=== Mobius's desk ===
[''Loki sits at Mobius's desk, looking at a jet ski magazine. A bell dings. A projection of Miss Minutes stands on the desk.'']

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Okay, y'all,
let's review what we've learned.
What happens when a nexus event
branches past red line?

'''LOKI:''' Very bad things.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Come on, Loki. What is it?

'''LOKI:''' 
[''Sighs.''] It's when the TVA can
no longer reset a nexus event.
Okay? Boring.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' 
Right. And that would lead
to the destruction of the timeline
and the collapse of reality as we know it.

'''LOKI:'''
Can you hear me?
Are you a recording? Or are you alive?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' 
Uh, sorta both.

'''LOKI:'''
Ah.

[''Loki rolls up the magazine and swats at Miss Minutes. She jumps out of the way.'']

'''MISS MINUTES:''' 
Watch it! Where's your manners?
Oh! Hey! Quit it!
That is not nice. Jerk.

[''Miss Minutes goes back into the computer screen.'']

'''LOKI:''' You can't hide...

'''MOBIUS:''' Training goin' well?

'''LOKI:''' Yeah.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Is that my jet ski magazine?
Put it down. Gear up.
There's been an attack. Let's go.

[''Mobius hands Loki a package. As they walk out, Loki opens it to pull out a TVA jacket.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Put it on.

[''Loki does.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Good. Yeah. Smart.

=== Mission briefing ===
'''HUNTER B-15:'''
C-20 and her team went dark
shortly after they jumped
into the 1985 branch.
All signs point to another ambush.
We've grabbed enough temporal aura
to know it's our Loki Variant.
But which kind of Loki, remains unknown.

'''LOKI:''' 
They're the lesser kind, to be clear.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' [''Sighs.''] Let me see
the back of that jacket.

[''Loki turns, showing the word "VARIANT" printed on the back. Hunter B-15 and the Minutemen look amused.'']

'''LOKI:''' 
Very subtle. Well done.

'''HUNTER B-15:'''
I don't want anybody out there
to forget what you are.

'''LOKI:''' 
Oh, your only hope
of capturing a murderer?

'''HUNTER B-15:'''
No. A cosmic mistake.

'''MOBIUS:''' That's enough.

'''LOKI:''' Lovely.

'''MOBIUS:''' Here's the deal.
When we get out on the branch,
we're not just
looking for a Time Criminal.
We're looking for a Loki.
A variation of this guy.

[''A projection comes up showing other Loki variants: L1247/L6792 (Jotunn blue skin), L1247 (in athletic clothes holding a trophy), L6792 (giant), L8914, L5681, L7803...'']

'''MOBIUS:''' 
A type we should
all be very familiar with,
because the TVA
has pruned a lotta these guys,
almost more than any other Variant.
And no two are alike.
Slight differences in appearances,
or not so slight.
Different powers, although,
powers, generally include
shape-shifting,
illusion-projection, and my favorite...

'''LOKI:''' Duplication-casting.

[''The project closes.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Illusion-projection.

'''LOKI:''' 
No, they're two
completely different powers actually.

'''MOBIUS:''' How?

'''LOKI:''' 
Illusion-projection involves depicting
a detailed image from outside oneself,
which is perceptible
in the external world,
whereas duplication-casting
entails recreating
an exact facsimile of one's own body
in its present circumstance,
which acts as a true holographic mirror
of its molecular structure.
But you already knew that.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Okay, take a breath. Noted.
We're gonna break into two teams,
including myself and Professor Loki.

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Why?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Because whoever this Variant is,
we haven't been able to find him.
So let's bring in an expert.

'''LOKI:''' 
That's me.

[''Loki and Mobius walking.'']

'''LOKI:''' Do I get a weapon?

'''MOBIUS:''' Nah.

'''LOKI:''' Well, I'll have my magic back.
Is no one concerned about that?

'''MOBIUS:''' Of what?

'''LOKI:''' Me betraying you.

'''MOBIUS:''' No.

'''LOKI:''' Why not?

'''MOBIUS:''' Because you know that we can catch you.
And how's betraying us gonna get you
any closer to the Time-Keepers?

'''LOKI:''' An audience
with the Time-Keepers is on the table?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Keep that focus.

[''The team goes through a Timedoor.'']

== Oshkosh, Wisconsin 1985 ==

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Apex of nexus signature located, ma'am.

'''LOKI:''' Let me ask you this,
why don't we just travel
back to before the attack,
when the Variant first arrives?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Nexus events destabilize the time flow.
This branch is still changing and growing,
so you gotta show up in real time.
Did you watch any of the training videos
you were supposed to?

'''LOKI:''' 
Well, as many as I could stand.
Your TVA propaganda is exhausting.

'''MINUTEMAN:'''
And what do these do?

'''LOKI:''' 
Reset charges prune the affected
radius of a branched timeline,
allowing time to heal all its wounds.
Which, by the way, sounds like a nice way
of saying "disintegrate
everything in its vicinity."

'''MOBIUS:''' 
He's on it.

'''LOKI:''' 
I watched the videos.
I mean, some of them.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' So he's taking hostages now?

'''MOBIUS:''' The Variant's never
taken a hostage before.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Maybe he's upping his game.

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Or he pruned her.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' A Loki couldn't
have gotten the jump on C-20.

'''LOKI:''' 
I think you underestimate, actually...

'''HUNTER B-15:''' 
Fan out and search for her.
And hurry up because we're at three units until red line.

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Let's go. She's right.

'''MOBIUS:''' Come on.

'''LOKI:''' Wait...
If you leave this tent,
you'll end up like them.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
What do you see?

'''LOKI:''' 
I see a scheme,
and in that scheme, I see myself.
We have a saying in Asgard,
"Where there are wolf's ears,
wolf's teeth are near."
It means to be aware of your surroundings.
Which is absurd, because my people are,
by nature, gullible fools.
A trait that I, the God of Mischief,
exploited time and time again
simply by listening.
My teeth were sharp,
but my ears even sharper.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' 
We're running out of time, Mobius.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Hold it. Just give him a chance.

'''LOKI:''' You remind me of them.
The Time Variance Authority
and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.
Those you underestimate will devour you.
You underestimate me,
just as you
underestimate this lesser Loki.
Which is why, you walk into
one wolf's mouth after another.

[''The TemPad beeps.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Two units. He is wasting our time.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Okay. Come on, Loki,
make a long story short.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' We need to look for C-20.

'''LOKI:''' 
That's exactly what
the Variant wants you to do.
It's a trap.
He's waiting for you outside this tent.

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Should I secure the reset charges?

'''LOKI:''' 
No. He wants me. I'm the key to his plan.
He knows that I'm stronger than him.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Almost one unit.

'''LOKI:''' 
And he rightly believes that together
we can overthrow and rule the TVA.
But that's not what I want.
I have a new purpose.
I am a servant of the Sacred Timeline.
Knowing
what I now know about his tactics,
I can deliver you the Variant...
but I need assurances.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Yeah?

'''LOKI:''' 
Assurances that I won't be
completely disintegrated
the moment the job has been done.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Right...

'''LOKI:''' 
[''Whispers''] We'll need to speak
to the Time-Keepers at once.
They're in graver danger than we realized.

[''The TemPad beeps.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' 
He's lying. Just playing games.
There's no one out there.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Reset the timeline.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
You had me for a second.
My ears are sharp too.

[''Reset charge is set and goes off, disintegrating everything in its vicinity to restore the timeline. On scanners in the TVA, the variant timeline receeds. A screen reads "TIMELINE RESET".'']

== TVA ==
=== Judge Ravonna Renslayer's Office ===

'''MOBIUS:''' Is it just me, or does this office
keep getting better and better?

[''Ravonna uncorks a bottle.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Where'd you get that one, the snow globe?
I love those.
I don't remember bringing back that case.

'''RAVONNA:'''
You're not the only analyst
working for me.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
But, would you say,
maybe, I'm your favorite one?
And why do you get to keep all
the trophies from my cases in here?
You don't think I'd love
having that roller skate
there sprucing up my cubicle?

'''RAVONNA:'''
Because I approve the missions.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Good point.

'''RAVONNA:'''
Speaking of which,
let's talk about the one you just botched.

[''Mobius groans. Ravonna hands him a drink.'']

'''RAVONNA:'''
You might need this for our discussion.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I hope it's a double.

'''RAVONNA:'''
This Variant is...
"Insubordinate, stubborn, unpredictable."
Sounds like someone else I know.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I was just thinking
it sounds like someone ''I'' know.

[''Mobius places his drink on a side table that's stained with glass rings.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Mobius?

'''MOBIUS:''' What?
Those rings were already there.

'''RAVONNA:'''
And they're all from you.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Maybe it's from
your other favorite analyst.
Listen, Ravonna, I'm sorry.
I realize that my, you know,
methods with this Loki
are controversial, but...

'''RAVONNA:'''
Towing a dangerous Variant
into the field is controversial.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Yeah, it didn't go exactly
the way I wanted it to today,
but here's what we did find out.
The Variant likes to stall for time,
and, eventually, we'll catch
the other one doing the same thing.
Because understanding
this Loki helps me get closer
to the one we're chasing. Right?

'''RAVONNA:'''
Look, I know you have
a soft spot for broken things.

'''MOBIUS:''' I don't think so.

'''RAVONNA:'''
Yes, you do.
But Loki is an evil, lying scourge.
That is the part he plays
on the Sacred Timeline.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Maybe he wants to mix it up.
Sometimes you get tired
of playing the same part.
Is that possible? He can change?

'''RAVONNA:'''
Not unless the Time-Keepers decree it.
And then, it shall be so.

'''MOBIUS:''' And how are the old Time-Keepers?

'''RAVONNA:'''
[''Sighs.''] How do you think?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
[''Chuckles.''] I don't know.
'Cause I've never met 'em.
Thankfully. Although,
I shouldn't say that.
That one looks...

'''RAVONNA:''' 
The Time-Keepers are monitoring
every aspect of this case.
I've never seen them so involved.
They want that Variant caught.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
So do I.

'''RAVONNA:'''
And this is the last chance
you're gonna get with this Loki.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Great. That's all I'm gonna need. [''Sighs.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Thank you, R Slayer.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I don't remember this.
This must be from that analyst
you keep on the side.

'''RAVONNA:'''
Stay focused.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Eyes on the road.

'''RAVONNA:''' Mobius?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I was almost gone.

'''RAVONNA:'''
You really believe in this Variant?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Mmm... Luckily, he believes in himself
enough for the both of us.
And, hey, if it doesn't work,
I'll delete him myself.
He's really arrogant.

[''Mobius leaves the office and whistles for Loki to join him. They walk back.'']

'''LOKI:''' 
You're probably wondering
what happened out on the mission.
That was your first lesson
in catching a Loki.
Expect the expected.
Half the fun of being a trickster
is knowing everyone knows
you're a trickster, and then,
many of your tricks
can come from exploiting
the fact that you know that they know...

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay. Just shut up!
Please. What happened
to the guy I met on the elevator?
Who didn't like to talk. Remember him?
Now I'm stuck with this guy
who won't stop yacking away
about what makes a Loki tick!

'''LOKI:''' 
What? Isn't that precisely why I'm here?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
No. I don't care what makes you tick.
You're here to help me catch
the superior version of yourself.
That's it!

'''LOKI:''' 
Hang on.
I'm not sure "superior"
is actually quite the right word.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
See? There it is. Right there.
I believed, stupidly,
that insecure need for validation
would motivate you to find the killer.
Not 'cause you care about
the TVA mission or bein' a hero,
but because you know this Variant
is better than you and you can't take it.

'''LOKI:''' 
Very nice.
I mean, it is adorable that you think
you could possibly manipulate me.
I'm ten steps ahead of you.
I've been playing a game
of my own all along.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
What, charm your way
in front of the Time-Keepers,
hustle them, and seize control of the TVA?
Am I getting warm?
A double cross
by history's most reliable liar.

'''LOKI:''' 
Okay. Why are you in there
sticking your neck out for me?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I'll give you two options,
and you can believe
whichever one you want.
A, because I see a scared
little boy, shivering in the cold.
And you kinda feel bad for that ice runt.
Or B, I just wanna catch this guy,
and I'll tell you whatever
I need to tell you.

[''They enter the elevator.'']

'''LOKI:''' 
I don't need your sympathy.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Good, 'cause I'm runnin' out of it.

'''LOKI:''' 
What's this then?
The next step of your manipulation...

'''MOBIUS:''' 
No, this is the final step.
Your last chance.

'''LOKI:''' 
Oh, and what does my desperate
last chance require?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Work.

'''LOKI:''' 
Work?

=== TVA archives ===

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I need you to go over each
and every one of the Variant's case files,
and then, give me your... How do I put it?
Your unique Loki perspective.
And who knows?
Maybe there's something that we missed.

'''LOKI:''' 
Well, you're idiots.
I suspect you probably missed a lot.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
That's why I'm lucky
I got ya for a little bit longer.
Let me park ya at this desk.
And don't be afraid
to really lean into this work.
Here's a good trick for you.
Pretend your life depends on it.
I'm gonna get a snack.

[''Loki looks through the files. He flips open another one to read it.'']

'''LOKI:''' 
[''Mocking'']
Oh, my goodness.
Don't tell me the Variant ambushed
and killed ''another'' team of Minutemen.
[''Gasp.''] And stole
their reset charge as well.

'''WOMAN:'''
Shh.

'''LOKI:''' 
Shh.

[''Loki approaches the archivist's desk where she's typing.'']

'''LOKI:'''
Hi.

[''She continues typing.'']

'''LOKI:''' 
Hello?

[''She continues typing. He ring the bell on her desk. She stops and looks at him.'']

'''ARCHIVIST:'''
Can I help you?

'''LOKI:''' 
Yes. I'm on some important TVA business.
Follow-up to a field mission.
You know how it goes.
We red lined near the apex, and...
Well, it's never good. [''Chuckles softly.'']
Um, I'd like all files pertaining
to the creation of the TVA, please.

'''ARCHIVIST:'''
Those are classified.

'''LOKI:''' 
Okay. I'd like all files pertaining
to the beginning of time then.

'''ARCHIVIST:''' Those are classified.

'''LOKI:''' 
Okay, the end of time.

'''ARCHIVIST:''' Those are classified.

'''LOKI:''' Okay, what files can I have?

[''In the stacks, the archivists pulls out a file and hands it to him. It's file on variant L1130 - himself.'']

'''ARCHIVIST:''' Happy reading.

[''Loki sighs.'']

[''Back at the desk, Loki pulls up the file on the Destruction of Asgard. Total planetary destruction. 9,719 casualties. Entire civilization annihilated. Zero variance energy detected. Loki grabs the file and goes to Mobius.'']

=== Cafeteria ===
'''LOKI:''' 
I found something.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
No, I said, "Don't bother me
until you've read all the files."

'''LOKI:''' I have.

'''MOBIUS:''' Every file?

'''LOKI:''' Yes.

'''MOBIUS:''' Pertaining to the Variant?

'''LOKI:''' The answer isn't in the files,
it's on the timeline.
He's hiding in apocalypses.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Which apocalypse?
Any time in history, there's, like, a million of 'em.

'''LOKI:''' 
Ragnarok. Are you familiar?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Yes. The destruction of Asgard
and most of its people. I'm sorry.

'''LOKI:''' 
Yes, very sad.
Anyway, it got me thinking...

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Go ahead.

'''LOKI:''' 
Nexus events
happen when someone does something
they're not supposed to do, right?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Well, it's a little more
complicated, but, yeah.

'''LOKI:''' 
Great. And then that thing
they're not supposed to do,
cascades into a whole range of other
things that aren't supposed to happen.
And so on and so forth, until eventually,
a new timeline branches. Yes?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Chaotic alterations
of a predetermined outcome.

'''LOKI:''' Exactly. 

'''MOBIUS:''' Mmm-hmm. 

'''LOKI:''' So, let's just say...

[''Loki takes Mobius's salad.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' What are you doing?

'''LOKI:''' ...your salad is Asgard in this scenario.

'''MOBIUS:''' No, it's not Asgard, that's my lunch.

'''LOKI:''' It's a metaphor. Just hang in there.

'''MOBIUS:''' I want that salad.

'''LOKI:''' 
And I could go down to Asgard
before Ragnarok
causes its complete destruction
and I could do anything I wanted.
I could, let's say,
push the Hulk off the Rainbow Bridge.

[''Loki starts shaking salt into Mobius's salad.'']

'''LOKI:''' There he goes.

'''MOBIUS:''' The salt's Hulk?

'''LOKI:''' And I could also...
Set fire to the palace.

[''Loki starts shaking pepper into Mobius's salad.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' 
No, just stop.
Don't set fire to the palace.

'''LOKI:''' 
Okay? I can do whatever I want to do,
and it would never matter.
It wouldn't go against the dictates
of the timeline because...

[''Loki picks up Mobius's can of Josta but it's empty. He runs to the next table where Casey is eating.'']

'''LOKI:''' Excuse me?

'''MOBIUS:''' Oh, God!

'''CASEY:''' You!

'''LOKI:''' Nice to see you.
I just need this for a second. Thanks.

[''Loki takes Casey's drink back to the table with Mobius and continues.'']

'''LOKI:''' Because the apocalypse is coming.
Ragnarok, Surtur will destroy
Asgard no matter what I do.

[''Loki pours the drink into the salad.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' No, don't do... [''Sighs.'']

'''LOKI:''' There's the apocalypse.

'''MOBIUS:''' That's the apocalypse?

'''LOKI:''' Ragnarok obliterates the salt.
Ragnarok.
There it is.

'''MOBIUS:''' What am I lookin' at?

'''LOKI:''' 
Okay, it was a clumsy metaphor.
But you see what I mean.
It doesn't matter.
It could be any apocalypse.
It could be a tidal wave.
It could be a meteor.
It could be a volcano, a supernova.
If everything and everyone around you
is destined for imminent destruction,
then nothing that I say or do will matter,
because the timeline's not gonna branch.
'Cause it gets destroyed.
Hence, the Variant could be
hiding in the apocalypse
and do whatever he wants,
and we wouldn't know!

'''MOBIUS:''' Not bad.

'''LOKI:''' 
Take me to a real apocalypse,
take me to Ragnarok, I'll show you.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
[''Chuckles.''] Yeah. So you can run away
back to your homeland? No.

'''LOKI:''' 
No, I'm not going home.
We can go anywhere.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I'm not taking you for a stroll along
the promenade, much less an apocalypse.

'''LOKI:''' 
Oh, Mobius, come on!
What could possibly go wrong?
We gotta properly test this theory.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Well, here's a fun theory.
You lure me out into the field,
and then you stab me in the back.
And that's a theory I don't wanna test.

'''LOKI:''' 
I'd never stab anyone in the back.
That's such a boring form of betrayal.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Loki, I've studied almost
every moment of your entire life.
You've literally stabbed
people in the back, like, 50 times.

'''LOKI:''' 
Well, I'd never do it again,
because it got old.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
[''chuckling''] Okay.

'''LOKI:''' 
Okay, look, you don't trust me,
you can trust one thing.
I love to be right.

== Pompeii, Italy 79 AD ==
[''Loki and Mobius are hidden to the side against a building, out of the way. People walks the streets. There's a rumble in the distant.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''Whispering.''] Here we go.

'''MOBIUS:''' Shh, any minute now.

'''LOKI:''' 
Until this entire town
is wiped off the face of this planet.
Imagine. All that volcanic ash...

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I know. We don't want to get too giddy.

'''LOKI:''' 
Oh, come on! It's cool.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
No, it is cool, but it's just, it's just
not in good taste because of...

'''LOKI:''' 
Well they're all gonna die anyway.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I know. Now listen, I'm gonna watch
the TemPad for any variance energy.

'''LOKI:''' Okay.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, because we gotta be careful.
If you're wrong,
and there's a good chance you are,
anything we do can create a huge branch.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, Mobius! You make even
the end of the world sound boring.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Listen! Okay, we're not meant to be here.
Okay?

'''LOKI:''' Okay.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Anything we do can impact
the course of history.
Do you get that?

'''LOKI:''' Yes. Yes.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
So we're gonna start
with very small disturbances.

'''LOKI:''' Very small.

'''MOBIUS:''' Can you make bird noises?

'''LOKI:''' Bird noises?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Yeah. Bird noises.
Like some, like, whooshing noises.
[''Mimics bird cooing noises.'']

'''LOKI:''' Oh. [''Groans.'']

[''Loki runs out into the street.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Loki! Loki!

[''Loki goes to a cart with goats. He opens the latch so they can escape.'']

'''LOKI:''' Go! [''Yipping.'']
Be free, my horned-friends, be free!
[''In Latin'']
''My name is Loki. We are agents of the Time Variance Authority.
I bring you all dark tidings.
All of you!
You're all about to die.
That volcano is about to erupt!
I would know, because I'm from the future.''
[''In English to Mobius''] We are
from the future, right?
What is the TVA?
I mean, it's from the future.
It sounds from the future.
It's pretty future-y.

[''The volcano rumbles in the distance and begins to erupt. People scream and begin to run.'']

'''LOKI:''' Right on cue! [''Chuckles.'']
Enjoy your last meal while you can!
Nothing matters!
Nothing has any consequence!
Dance while you still can!
Whoo-hoo!
How'd we do?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I don't believe it. Zero variance energy.
No branching in the timeline.

'''LOKI:''' 
The TVA would never
even know we were here.
If it were me, this is where I would hide.

== TVA ==
=== Mobius's desk ===
'''MOBIUS:''' 
Doomsdays. The Variant's been
ambushing our soldiers
and hiding out in doomsdays
to cover his tracks.

'''LOKI:''' You're welcome.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah.
But in order for this theory to hold,
the disasters have to be
naturally-occurring,
sudden, no warning, no survivors.

'''LOKI:''' How many of those disasters could there possibly be?

'''MOBIUS:''' I don't know.
We're gonna find out.

=== TVA archives ===
[''Loki and Mobius are back at the desk in the archives, files all around them. Loki has fallen asleep.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Hey?
Come on, let's take a walk.

[''They go to the cafe. It's empty except for them.'']

'''LOKI:''' 
By the way, at your desk, that magazine?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Yeah. The one on jet skis?

'''LOKI:''' 
Yes.
Why do you have that?

'''MOBIUS:''' Because they're awesome.

'''LOKI:''' [''Chuckles.''] I suppose they are.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah.
You know, some things... Actually,
most things in history are kinda dumb,
and everything gets ruined eventually.
But in the early 1990s,
for a brief, shining moment,
there was a beautiful union
of form and function,
which we call the jet ski,
and a reasonable man cannot differ.

'''LOKI:''' 
You ever been on one?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
No... No.
I think a TVA agent showing up
on a jet ski on the Sacred Timeline,
that would create a branch for sure.

'''LOKI:''' 
Oh it'd be fun, though.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Yeah, it'd be really fun.

'''LOKI:''' 
So, why read about them?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
It just helps remind me
of what we're fighting for.

'''LOKI:''' 
I mean, you really believe
in all this stuff, don't you?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I don't get hung up on,
"Believe, not believe."
I just accept what is.

'''LOKI:''' Three magic lizards...

'''MOBIUS:''' Time-Keepers.

'''LOKI:''' ...created the TVA, and everyone in it...

'''MOBIUS:''' Right.

'''LOKI:''' ...including you?

'''MOBIUS:''' Including me.

'''LOKI:''' 
You see, every time I start
to admire your intelligence,
you say something like that.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, who created you, Loki?

'''LOKI:''' 
A Frost Giant of Jotunheim.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
And who raised you?

'''LOKI:''' 
Odin of Asgard.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Odin, God of the Heavens.
Asgard, mystical realm, beyond the stars.
Frost Giants. Listen to yourself...

'''LOKI:''' It's not the same.
It's completely different.

'''MOBIUS:''' No no no.

'''LOKI:''' It's not the same.

'''MOBIUS:''' Actually it's exactly the same thing.
Because if you think too hard
about where any of us came from,
who we truly are,
it sounds kinda ridiculous.
Existence is chaos.
Nothing makes any sense,
so we try to make some sense of it.
And I'm just lucky that the chaos
I emerged into gave me all this...
My own glorious purpose.

[''Loki scoffs.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' 
'Cause the TVA is my life.
And it's real because I believe it's real.

'''LOKI:''' 
Fair enough. You believe it's real.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Yeah.

'''LOKI:''' 
So everything is written.
Past, present, future.
There's no such thing as free will.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Well, I mean, you know,
it's an oversimplification...

'''LOKI:''' 
So, in fact, in a way,
you and I here at the TVA,
we're the only ones who are actually free.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Where are you going with this, Loki?

'''LOKI:''' 
How does it all end?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
That's a work in progress.

'''LOKI:''' 
Oh, those lazy Time-Keepers.
What are they waiting for?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
''Au contraire.''
No. Because while we protect
what came before,
they're toiling away in their chamber,
untangling the epilogue
from its infinite branches.

'''LOKI:''' 
Ah, I see. So, when they're finished,
what happens then?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
So are we.
No more nexus events.
Just order.
And we meet in peace at the end of time.
Nice, right?

'''LOKI:''' Only order?

'''MOBIUS:''' Mmm-hmm.

'''LOKI:''' 
No chaos? It sounds boring.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I'm sure it does to you.

'''LOKI:''' 
You know, you called me a scared little boy.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I called you a lotta things.

'''LOKI:''' 
You did.
You're wrong, though.
You see, I know something children don't.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
What's that?

'''LOKI:''' 
That no one bad is ever truly bad.
And no one good is ever truly good.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Scared little boy.

'''LOKI:''' 
Yes, it was quite patronizing.
I thought it was a bit too far, actually.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
You're very clever.

[''Mobius gets up.'']

'''LOKI:''' 
I know.

=== Archives ===
[''Back in the stacks, Mobius pulls open a box.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' 
The Variant left something
behind at an old crime scene.
A cathedral. A candy box.
An obvious anachronism.
I gave it to Analysis,
but they couldn't find anything real.

'''LOKI:''' Why does that matter?

'''MOBIUS:''' 'Cause now we have two variables.
Apocalyptic natural disasters and... Kablooie.

'''LOKI:''' What's that?

'''MOBIUS:''' Candy. Do you have candy on Asgard?

'''LOKI:''' 
Yeah. Grapes, nuts.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
No wonder you're so bitter.

[''Back at the desk.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Okay. Kablooie was only sold
regionally on Earth from 2047 to 2051.
All you gotta do is cross-reference
that with every apocalyptic event.
I'm gonna give you half.
And let's make it a competition, see who finds it.

'''LOKI:''' Sure.

'''MOBIUS:''' What, you wanna bet something?

'''LOKI:''' Yeah.

'''MOBIUS:''' Gentleman's bet.
Yeah, let's play for pride.
Okay. May the best man win. Go.

[''They begin going through the files.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Anything?

'''LOKI:''' Uh...
It's not the climate disaster of 2048.
Or the tsunami of 2051.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

'''LOKI:''' 
2050.
The extinction of the swallow...
Is that a thing?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
Completely screwed up the ecosystem.

'''LOKI:''' 
Krakatoa erupted in 2049 as well.
No Kablooie.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
God, it's just one damn thing
after another, isn't it?
Cyclone, famine, volcanoes, floods...

'''LOKI:''' Got him.

[''Loki shows Mobius a file on an apocalyptic event: Class ten apocalypse; category 8 hurricane; 10,835 casualties; Haven Hills, Alabama.'']

'''LOKI:''' That's where he is.

'''MOBIUS:''' Alabama, 2050.
You're gonna take my job
if I'm not careful.

=== Ravonna Renslayer's office ===
'''RAVONNA:''' You want me to approve deployment
of a fully-armed task force to...

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah.

'''RAVONNA:''' ...the Variant's ''potential'' hiding spot?

'''MOBIUS:''' Haven Hills, Alabama,
corporate town
owned by Roxxcart until
it's wiped out by a hurricane.
All the food and supplies you need.
If he likes it there, there's no reason
he can't keep going back
and just camping out, over and over.

'''RAVONNA:''' 
And this is all based
on a theory from the Variant
who just blew your previous mission?

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah, he's doing great.

'''RAVONNA:''' 
Mobius, as your friend,
I have to tell you that trusting
this man is not a good idea.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
No no, I know.
But maybe he's worth the trouble.
He just uncovered
a massive hole in our security, right?

'''RAVONNA:''' 
That's what concerns me!

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I can handle him. Trust me.
This is where we get our guy.

'''RAVONNA:''' 
You, I trust, but him.

'''RAVONNA:''' 
Listen, Ravonna,
every instinct is telling me
this is where we nail the Variant.
Come on. You don't see me
usually this worked up, right?
I'm, I'm  excited.
I'm chomping at the bit.

'''RAVONNA:''' Okay.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yes. Okay.

'''RAVONNA:''' But, Mobius?

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah?

'''RAVONNA:''' 
There's not much I can do
if it doesn't work out.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
For all time.

'''RAVONNA:''' 
Always.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay.

=== Mission briefing ===
[''Mobius leaves Ravonna's office, where Loki is sitting, waiting for him.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' We're on.

[''They walk to the briefing.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' We are doing some good work today.

'''LOKI:''' I thought so too.

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I'm tellin' you.
You actually help us catch this Variant,
and who knows, my friend.

'''LOKI:''' 
What, good enough for a face-to-face
with the Time-Keepers?

'''MOBIUS:''' 
I didn't say that.
One step at a time.

'''LOKI:''' All right. One step at a time.

'''MOBIUS:''' Just in case.

[''Mobius hands Loki his knives.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah, don't those feel...

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Absolutely not.

[''Hunter B-15 takes the knives from Loki and places them in a locker. She turns to the team.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Gather around for a briefing.
Roxxcart is a vast superstore
common to the era.
It consists of a series
of sprawling sections,
including a large warehouse.
This warehouse is being used by civilians
as a shelter tryin' to ride out the storm.
Remember, this is a class ten apocalypse.
While the Variant
shouldn't know we're coming,
he could be hiding anywhere
and should be considered hostile.
So stay alert.
Every time there is an attack,
the Variant steals a reset charge.
He's planning something.
We just don't know what.
So keep an eye out
for the missing charges,
and if you see a Loki, prune it.

'''LOKI:''' The bad Loki, preferably.

== Roxxcart in Haven Hills, Alabama 2050 ==
[''Raining heavily. Thunder rumbles. A communications tower crashes through a bright electric "Haven Hills, Alabama" sign. Fires erupt around the dark town. The Roxxcart store is brightly lit with a blue sign. The team comes out in the Roxxcart parking lot.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Anything?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Nothing yet. Move out!

[''The team enters the Roxxcart store. Loki sighs and uses magic, and suddenly he's dry.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' The hell was that?

'''LOKI:''' That was me using magic to dry my clothes.
So I don't announce myself with every
squeaky footstep like the rest of you.

[''Thunder rumbles. The power flickers.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Take both teams
and sweep the storm shelter.

'''HUNTER D-90:''' Yes, ma'am.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, Loki and I are gonna
check out the Green House. We'll meet back at the showroom.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' No.

'''MOBIUS:''' No?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' You go with D-90. He stays with me.

'''MOBIUS:''' What are you talking about? He's under my supervision.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' This is my field op, Mobius.
If he's not a threat, then it won't be a problem.

'''MOBIUS:''' Of course he's a threat.
Do you not remember the Time Theater? 

'''LOKI:''' Mobius...

'''MOBIUS:''' That's why I want him with me.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' You are welcome to go back
to the TVA and litigate
with Renslayer, but right now...

'''MOBIUS:''' We're here. We're not going back.
The Variant is here.

'''LOKI:''' Mobius, it's fine. It's fine.
You can trust me.
I understand
I have to earn that, so, I will.

'''MOBIUS:''' Why is it the people you can't trust
are always saying, "Trust me"?
Okay, try to hang on
to your Time Collar this time.

'''HUNTER D-90:''' 
We'll see you in the showroom.

[''The team splits up. Meanwhile, the Variant watches the exchange on the store's security cameras. The Variant sets a TemPad with a 20 minute countdown.'']

=== Green house ===

'''LOKI:''' I for one am glad we're getting
to spend this time together.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Quiet.

[''Sound of soft clicking in an aisle.'']

'''LOKI:''' I'm saying we got off on the wrong...

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Shh.

[''They see a person looking at plants on a shelf. Hunter B-15 lifts her weapon.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Hey!

'''SHOPPER:''' 
Whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' What are you doing?

'''SHOPPER:''' Shopping for plants.

'''LOKI:''' In this storm?

'''SHOPPER:'''
It's a hurricane sale.
Azaleas are half off.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' 
[''Whispers to Loki''] Could that be you?

'''LOKI:''' 
[''Whispers''] I mean, I probably would have
worn a suit, but... yes, maybe.

[''Hunter B-15 approaches the man, who touches her arm and green magic runs from him into her. The man collapses.'']

'''LOKI:''' Is he dead?

'''THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15:'''
No. They usually survive.
So, you're the fool
the TVA brought in to hunt me down.

'''LOKI:''' Me, I presume.

'''THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15:''' 
Please. If anyone's anyone, you're me.

'''LOKI:''' 
How nice to meet you.

=== Shelter ===
[''Mobius and his team enter the shelter. The news is on. A baby is crying.'']

'''NEWS ANCHOR:''' For the past hour
we have seen winds intensifying.
Again, if you're just tuning in...

'''HUNTER D-90:''' Check the bags
for the reset charges.

'''ROXXCART EMPLOYEE:'''
You guys FEMA?
National Guard?

'''MINUTEMAN:'''
Could be any one of them.

'''ROXXCART EMPLOYEE:'''
Well, hey, if you got
a 'copter or other transport,
now is the time to use it.
We got women and kids,
and that weather ain't playin'.

'''MOBIUS:'''
No, I'm sorry. We don't.

'''ROXXCART EMPLOYEE:'''
Well, how the heck did you get here?

[''Hunter D-90 pushes the man out of the way to begin searching bags.'']

'''MOBIUS:'''
What are you doing?
Hey! These people are scared.

'''HUNTER D-90:'''
They're about to die.
They should be scared.

'''MOBIUS:'''
Okay. Not of us.
Take it easy.

'''MINUTEMAN:'''
Sir!

'''MOBIUS:'''
What is it?

[''The minuteman takes Mobius to a room where Hunter C-20 is sitting on the ground.'']

'''HUNTER C-20:''' [''Breathing heavily.'']
It's real. It's real. It's real.
It's real. It's real. It's real.

=== Store ===

'''LOKI:''' 
Enchantment is a clever trick.
Cowardly, a bit amateur-ish, but clever.

'''THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15:'''
Almost as cowardly as working for the TVA.

'''LOKI:''' 
I'm working for me.

'''THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15:'''
[''Scoffs.''] You really believe that,
don't you?

'''LOKI:'''
Yeah.

'''THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15:'''
[''Chuckles.'']
And here I was worried
that they'd found a better version of me.

[''An employee approaches.'']

'''RANDY:'''
Hi, are you guys looking
for the disaster shelter?

'''THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15:'''
No.

[''The Variant / Hunter-B15 touches Randy's arm. With a flash of magic, Hunter B-15 collapses, unconscious. Green magic flashes in Randy's eyes. Loki checks Hunter B-15.'']

'''THE VARIANT / RANDY:''' Oh, bless.
Are you going to call your little friends
for help? [''Chuckles.'']

'''LOKI:''' What's the matter?
You too scared to meet me face-to-face?
Show yourself.
You know, gaining their confidence
was no mean feat.

'''THE VARIANT / RANDY:''' 
Oh, my God.
You went undercover.

'''LOKI:'''
If you could possibly sheathe
your smarm for a moment,
I have an offer for you.
That's why I found you.

'''THE VARIANT / RANDY:''' 
Go on.

'''LOKI:'''
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.
And, uh, cards on the table,
I could use a qualified lieutenant.

'''THE VARIANT / RANDY:''' 
And I assume you mean... Me?

'''LOKI:'''
What say you...
Loki?

'''THE VARIANT / RANDY:''' 
Ugh. Don't call me that.
You can call me... [''Looks down the nametag.'']
Randy.

'''LOKI:'''
God. Now I understand
why Thor found this so annoying.
Listen, enough with your games.
I've been trying to help you.
I kept them vulnerable
at the Renaissance Fair for some time.

'''THE VARIANT / RANDY:''' 
Oh, gosh,
and that was just so nice of you.
But after eight to ten seconds
of consideration,
the answer is no.
I'm not interested in ruling
the Time Variance Authority.

[''The Variant / Randy walks off, and Loki follows. Unseen by Loki, behind a shelf a reset charge is set up. The variant connects a wire.'']

'''HUNTER D-90:'''
She's off the dial.

'''HUNTER C-20:''' It's real.

'''MOBIUS:''' Look at me.

'''HUNTER C-20:''' It's real.
I wanna go home.

'''MOBIUS:'''
We're gonna get you there.
Call the TVA, let the infirmary know...

'''HUNTER C-20:''' No, no, no. I gave it away.
I gave it away.

'''HUNTER D-90:''' What did you give away...

'''HUNTER C-20:''' 
The Time-Keepers, where they are.
I gave it away how to find them.

'''HUNTER D-90:''' [''into radio''] B-15, what is your status?

=== Store ===
'''HUNTER D-90:''' [''over radio''] ''B-15, come in. What's your status?''

[''HUNTER B-15 starts to get up.'']

'''LOKI:''' 
If you don't wanna rule the TVA,
then what do you want?

'''THE VARIANT / RANDY:''' 
It doesn't matter. You're too late.

'''LOKI:''' 
Well I think you'll find
I'm well ahead of schedule.
I found your hiding place like that. [''Snaps fingers.'']
I'd say that makes me
the superior Loki, wouldn't you?

[''Loki sees a reset charge connected with wires.'']

'''LOKI:'''
[''Sighs.''] I see. That's your plan.
Lure us all here
so you can blow the place up.

[''He looks back to The Variant / Randy, but he's gone. As he looks around, someone kicks him down. The Variant, in a new man's body, chuckles.'']

'''LOKI:''' 
I miss Randy.

[''The Variant / Man kicks Loki again.'']

'''THE VARIANT / MAN:'''
Thank you for helping me stall for time.
You really do love to hear yourself talk.

'''LOKI:''' 
[''Panting.''] You're the first person
to tell me that.

[''The Variant / Man throws Loki across the floor. He mumbles in mockery of what Loki said.'']

'''LOKI:''' 
I would never treat me like this.

[''Loki gets to his feet and faces The Variant / Man.'']

'''LOKI:'''
Hi.

[''They fight. Loki uses magic to bring a rumba-like appliance to shield himself.'']

'''LOKI:'''
Oh, come on. Stop hiding.

[''The Variant / Man throws Loki aside and tosses away the appliance. Loki grabs a vacuum cleaner as a weapon and they fight. The Variant tries to strangle Loki with the electric cord.'']

'''LOKI:'''
If you had any honor
you'd fight me as yourself.

'''THE VARIANT / MAN:'''
I have shit to do.

'''LOKI:'''
Enough!

[''The Variant / Man throws Loki through a stack of boxes. Electric toy dogs drive around him and bark.'']

[''Hunter B-15 meets up with Mobius and Hunter D-90.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Mobius.

'''MOBIUS:'''
Where is he?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' 
I lost him.

'''MOBIUS:'''
What happened?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' 
I...

'''HUNTER D-90:'''
Looks like your favorite
Loki betrayed you.

'''MOBIUS:''' Just move!

[''The Variant / Man connects a TemPad. Loki gets back up and walks toward him.'']

'''LOKI:'''
What do you want from me?
What is this about?

'''THE VARIANT / MAN:''' [''Chuckles.''] Brace yourself, Loki.

[''The Variant / Man laughs. His eyes flash green with magic, and then he collapses. Loki sighs. Behind is the sound of a recording of Loki's words.'']

'''LOKI RECORCING:'''
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

What do you want from me?
What is this about?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

[''Loki turns to see The Variant, cloaked and hooded. The Variant pulls back her hood, revealing herself.'']

'''THE VARIANT:''' This isn't about you.

'''LOKI:''' Right.

[''The timer on the TemPad reaches zero. The power in the store goes out and the lights go dark. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of reset charges activate. Small Timedoors begin opening beneath each other, dropping them to other destinations.'']

'''MOBIUS:'''
Where they going?

== TVA ==
[''The timeline monitor beeps, showing multiple branches of the timeline.'']

'''CHRONOMONITOR:'''
That's not possible.

'''ANALYST 1182-E:'''
This is Analyst 1182-E,
uh, reporting a code, uh, 000.
Branches rapidly forming at a slope...

'''CHRONOMONITOR:'''
Somebody just bombed the Sacred Timeline.

[''The monitor shows branches across worlds and times, including Earth, Vormir, Sakaar, Ego, Titan, and Xandar.'']

[''Timedoors open and Minutemen run through.'']

== Roxxcart in Haven Hills, Alabama 2050 ==
[''The red emergency lights have come on. Loki turns back to The Variant. She lifts the TemPad and opens a Timedoor. She waves to him and steps through. He takes a few steps toward her. The lights partially come back on, some white, some backup red. Mobius and the team runs up the aisle behind him. Loki looks back at them.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Loki!
Loki, wait!
Wait! Loki, wait!
No! Wait, Loki!

'''LOKI:''' Is this the greatest power
in the universe?

'''MOBIUS:''' A fugitive Variant's been killing
our Minutemen.

[''Minuteman grunts as Sylvie / Hunter C-20 beats him.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Whoever this Variant is,
we haven't been able to find him.

'''LOKI:''' The Time Variance Authority
and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.

'''RENSLAYER:''' The Time-Keepers are monitoring
every aspect of this case.

'''LOKI:''' He's hiding in apocalypses.

'''THE VARIANT / HUNTER B-15:''' You're the fool
the TVA brought in to hunt me down.

'''LOKI:''' Me, I presume.
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.

'''THE VARIANT / RANDY:''' I'm not interested in ruling
the Time Variance Authority.

[''Loki grunts as The Variant throws him in a fight.'']

'''HUNTER C-20:''' I gave it away.
The Time-Keepers, where they are.

Wait! Loki, wait!
No! Wait, Loki!

[''Demons by Hayley Kiyoko plays. In a restaurant, Hunter C-20 sits at a table with a drink in front of her. She looks over the menu. The Variant (Sylvie) sits across from her.'']

'''HUNTER C-20:''' We could do potato skins
or buffalo fingers...

'''SYLVIE:''' Or we could eat somewhere else.

'''HUNTER C-20:''' [''Scoffs.''] Why do you hate this place?

'''SYLVIE:''' I don't hate it, I fear it.
Do you know how many times
the health department has
closed this place down?

'''HUNTER C-20:''' Well, the drinks seem fine.

[''Hunter C-20 takes a drink and cringes. Sylvie laughs.'']

'''HUNTER C-20:''' Oh, God!
Ah, brain freeze!

'''SYLVIE:''' You know what brain freeze is, don't you?

'''HUNTER C-20:''' [''Sighs.''] Here we go.

'''SYLVIE:''' It's when you sip something so cold...

'''HUNTER C-20:''' Brain freeze associated with coldness...
Got it.

'''SYLVIE:''' Wait, I'm being serious.
So, it permeates the roof of your mouth
and it freezes the synapses in your brain.
So, your memories
are literally frozen in place.

'''HUNTER C-20:''' That is absolutely not true.

'''SYLVIE:''' It is!
Okay. Try it. Whatever you're thinking
about will get frozen in place.
I'm gonna ask you a question,
and you won't be able to answer
until the synapses have melted.

'''HUNTER C-20:''' Challenge accepted.

[''Hunter C-20 takes another drink and cringes with brain freeze.'']

'''HUNTER C-20:''' Okay, ask.

'''SYLVIE:''' How many people are guarding
the Time-Keepers?

'''HUNTER C-20:''' I'm sorry, what?

[''The scene shifts. It's now night and there's loud upbeat music.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Hey, how long have we been best friends?

'''HUNTER C-20:''' Too long.

'''HUNTER C-20:''' Seriously though, you know you
can tell me anything, right?

'''SYLVIE:''' Of course.

'''HUNTER C-20:''' So why won't you tell me how many people
are guarding the Time-Keepers?

'''HUNTER C-20:''' Oh, well, there's...

[''Hunter C-20 stops. Confused. Looks around.'']

'''HUNTER C-20:''' This place, I...
I remember, I know this place.
But I don't know you.

'''SYLVIE:''' It's okay. You're just tired.

== Roxxcart 2050 ==
[''Hunter C-20 sits on the ground, eyes closed. The Variant has her hand to Hunter C-20's template, her fingers glow green with magic.'']

'''HUNTER C-20:''' Yeah. I'm probably just tired.

'''SYLVIE:''' How do I find the elevators?

'''HUNTER C-20:''' They're gold.

[''Sylvie chuckles and releases the connection. She looks toward the CCTV cameras and sees Loki, Mobius, and the others walking to the store in the rain. Her smile drops.'']

[''Opening theme.'']

== TVA ==
[''A Timedoor opens into the TVA and Sylvie walks through. She pulls her hair back.'']

'''ANNOUNCER:''' [''Over speakers.'']
All Minutemen to armory.
Protect the timeline.
[''Alarm sounding.'']
All Minutemen to armory.
Protect the timeline.

[''Sylvie approaches a Minuteman reporting over the phone.'']

'''MINUTEMAN:''' I don't know, sir.

[''Sylvie touches his temple, but her magic fizzes, not working. The man stumbles from the brief connection and turns. They fight, Sylvie takes his pruning stick. He screams as she prunes him. More Minuteman hear it down the hallway. They fight with Sylvie. She drops two of them and prunes the third.'']

[''Back at the Timedoor, Loki runs through and the Timedoor closes behind him.'']

'''ANNOUNCER:''' All Minutemen to armory.
Protect the timeline.

[''Loki looks the locker where Hunter B-15 places his daggers. Loki follows after Sylvie, daggers out, past the fallen Minutemen.'']

[''At the gold elevator, Sylvie approaches the two guards.'']

'''Guard:''' Hey! Stop!

[''They fight. One screams as Sylvie breaks his hand, and she twists him in front of her so he's pruned by the other guard who was aiming at her. She knocks down the second guard. Loki walks into the hallway.'']

'''LOKI:''' A few questions.

'''SYLVIE:''' Have you really got nothing else better to do?

'''LOKI:''' Rude.
Are you sure you're a Loki?

'''SYLVIE:''' You're in my way.

'''LOKI:''' You ''are'' my way.

[''They start to fight.'']

'''LOKI:''' I thought perhaps we could work together.

[''Sylvie attacks again.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''Panting.''] But now I see you lack vision.

[''Sylvie groans and turns back to the elevators.'']

'''LOKI:''' So, either you'll come willingly...

[''Loki grabs her arm and they fight.'']

'''LOKI:''' Or you won't. Either way,
that's how I get to meet the Time-Keepers.

'''SYLVIE:''' Oh, God. Shut up!

[''They fight.'']

'''RENSLAYER:''' Hey!

[''Renslayer and two Minutemen power up their weapons. Sylvie twists in Loki's hold and puts her sword to him.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Come any closer and I'll kill him.

'''RENSLAYER:'''  Go for it.

[''Renslayer approaches. Loki grabs the TemPad from Sylvie's waist and opens a Timedoor beneath them. They fall through as Renslayer swings her weapon at them.'']

== Lamentis-1 2077 ==
=== Abandoned mining station ===
[''Sylvie and Loki land in a tent. Sylvie goes for the TemPad, which has landed on the ground. She and Loki struggle.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Get off my leg!

[''Sylvie gets the TemPad.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Goodbye, Variant.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' You're outta juice.

[''The TemPad shows a low battery.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' It's not working.

[''Loki teleports behind Sylvie and he knocks her down. He picks up the TemPad.'']

'''LOKI:''' Right...

'''SYLVIE:''' Just give it to me.
You don't even know how to Recharge it.

'''LOKI:''' Of course I do.
You're not the only tech savvy Loki.

'''SYLVIE:''' Don't ever call me that.

'''LOKI:''' Tech savvy?

'''SYLVIE:''' No, a Loki.

[''Sylvie grabs at the TemPad, but Loki disappears it with magic.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' So you're just fully a magician then?

'''LOKI:''' Fine. For my next trick,
I'll make you disappear.

[''They face off to fight again. A small meteor comes through the roof and strikes the ground between them.'']

'''LOKI:''' Is that one of your powers?

'''SYLVIE:''' Where did you send us?

[''Outside, meteors crash down all around them. A shattered planet looms in the sky.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' You idiot! This is Lamentis-1.

'''LOKI:''' I don't know what that means!

'''SYLVIE:''' The moon that planet is about to
crash into and destroy.

[''They begin to run.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Of all of the apocalypses
saved on that TemPad, this is the worst!
No one makes it off here!
Watch out! 

[''Sylvie grabs Loki to pull him out of the way of a meteor.'']

'''LOKI:''' I'm sorry, madam.
Didn't have time to scan the brochure.

[''They take cover under a large vehicle.'']

'''LOKI:''' By the way, I thought you wanted me dead.

'''SYLVIE:''' I don't know where you hid that TemPad,
but if you blow up, it blows up,
and then I end up blown up.
There!

[''She points at a mining shack and they begin running toward it.'']

'''LOKI:''' So we're a team now?

'''SYLVIE:''' Oh, God, no!

'''LOKI:''' Get down!

[''Suylvie gasps as Loki pulls her out of the way of a meteor.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Didn't need your help!

'''LOKI:''' You're so weird!

[''Loki gets to the mining shack first and opens the door. Sylvie runs through and they both enter, breathing hard from the run. Loki leans against a wall. Sylvie walks up to him and touches his neck. Her hand shimmers green with magic. Loki looks at her.'']

'''LOKI:''' What are you doing?

'''SYLVIE:''' What are you doing?

'''LOKI:''' You trying to enchant me?
It won't work.

'''SYLVIE:''' Why? Because you're a magician?

'''LOKI:''' No, because my mind is too strong.

'''SYLVIE:''' Fine!

[''Sylvie pulls her sword and Loki pulls his daggers.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''Sighs.''] Look. Are we really
about to do this here? Again?

'''SYLVIE:''' Well what do you propose instead?

'''LOKI:''' I don't know. A truce?

[''Sylvie scoffs.'']

'''LOKI:''' Listen, neither of us
is getting off this rock
if we can't turn that TemPad turned back on.

'''SYLVIE:''' Where do you have it hidden?

'''LOKI:''' In my heart.

'''SYLVIE:''' Well, then, I'll cut it out.

'''LOKI:''' Nice. Very droll. Lovely.
Okay, yes, I do have the TemPad,
but I'm not gonna get very far
if you keep trying to kill me every thirty seconds.

'''SYLVIE:''' Well you're full of it because
you need me to get that thing recharged.
That's the only reason
you saved me out there.

'''LOKI:''' Maybe.
Yeah. I mean, sure. That too.
Or we could slaughter each other here
in this abandoned mining shack.
What do you say?

'''SYLVIE:''' Good for me.

[''Meteors continue to crash outside.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' The plan you interrupted
was years in the making.
Years!

'''LOKI:''' Okay, got it.

'''SYLVIE:''' And as soon as I turn that TemPad back on,
I'm going straight back to the TVA
to finish what I started.

'''LOKI:''' Good.

'''SYLVIE:''' I'll kill you then.

'''LOKI:''' Or I'll kill you.

[''Sylvie scoffs and heads for the door.'']

'''LOKI:''' Where're you going?

'''SYLVIE:''' There's power somewhere on this moon.
We just need enough of it to travel
through inter-dimensional time and space.

[''Meteors crash loudly outside.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Jeez!

'''LOKI:''' Yep.

[''Sylvie leaves and Loki follows after.'']

=== Walking to town ===
'''LOKI:''' [''Panting.''] So, what's the plan?

'''SYLVIE:''' There's a town near here.
And can you shut up?
Just because I have to work with you
doesn't mean I wanna hear your voice.

'''LOKI:''' All right, well... Slow down, Variant.

'''SYLVIE:''' What part of imminent death confuses you?
And don't call me "Variant."

'''LOKI:''' I'm sorry, but I'm not calling
some faded photocopy of me "Loki."

'''SYLVIE:''' Good. 'Cause that's not who I am anymore.
I'm Sylvie now.

'''LOKI:''' Oh you changed your name. Brilliant.

'''SYLVIE:''' It's called an alias.

'''LOKI:''' Well it's not very Loki-like.

'''SYLVIE:''' Yeah? What exactly makes a Loki a Loki?

'''LOKI:''' [''Sighs.''] Independence, authority, style.

'''SYLVIE:''' So, naturally you went to work
for the boring, oppressive time police.

'''LOKI:''' I don't work for them.
I'm a... consultant.

'''SYLVIE:''' You don't know what you want.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, yeah? What about you?
Your years-in-the-making plan
was to tear the place down,
create the ultimate power vacuum,
and then just walk away.
I'd never have done that.

'''SYLVIE:''' Yeah? Well, I'm not you.
Can we get on with this now?

[''Loki sighs and continues after her.'']

=== Town ===
'''LOKI:''' It looks like everyone already fled.

'''SYLVIE:''' If they did, it was in vain.

'''LOKI:''' How long do we have?

'''SYLVIE:''' Twelve hours or so.
Things down here are only gonna get worse.
More meteors, gravity quakes,
and of course, the collapse of society
in the face of annihilation.

[''Loki indicates a lit sign.'']

'''LOKI:''' Could that charge the TemPad?

'''SYLVIE:''' Maybe.

[''She hurries up the ramp to it.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' I'm just checking the coupling.
Making sure it can connect.

'''LOKI:''' Right.

'''SYLVIE:''' Okay. Hand it over.

'''LOKI:''' [''Snickers.'']
Pitiful. I'm not giving it to you.
You're gonna have to try harder than that.

'''SYLVIE:''' Then don't give me
your "tech savvy" ideas either.
The TemPad requires
a massive power source, not a night light.

=== Homestead ===
[''They walk on, meteors falling around them. They approach a homestead. Sylvie draws her sword and Loki grabs her arm.'']

'''LOKI:''' Brute force is no substitute
for diplomacy and guile.

'''SYLVIE:''' Noted.

[''Sylvie kicks the door in -- and is immediately thrown backwards by an energy blast wielded by the woman living there. Sylvie groans.'']

'''LOKI:''' It's remarkable
that you ever made it as far as you did. 
[''Calling into the house.'']
Sorry about that.

'''WOMAN:''' Don't be. I enjoyed it.

'''LOKI:''' Oh... [''Chuckles.''] I did too.
But I can assure you,
despite my acquaintance
behaving like an animal...

[''Sylvie scoffs.'']

'''LOKI:''' ...uh, we mean you no harm.
We're simply weary travelers.

'''WOMAN:''' Sure you are.

[''Loki looks through the window and see a photograph of a woman and a man. He uses his magic to appear as the photographed man, and steps in front of the door.'']

'''LOKI / PATRICE:''' Hello, dear.

'''WOMAN:''' Patrice?

[''Loki / Patrice nods and starts to cry.'']

'''LOKI / PATRICE:''' It... It's been a long time.
You're as beautiful as I've...

[''Loki is blasted backwards, and lands besides Sylvie on the ground. Sylvie chuckles. Loki sits up with a groan.'']

'''WOMAN:''' Patrice never said
a thing that nice in 30 years.
You're no travelers, you're devils.

'''SYLVIE:''' Which one was that? Diplomacy?
Or... [''Chuckles.'']

'''LOKI:''' Don't. Just don't.

'''WOMAN:''' What do you devils want with me?

'''SYLVIE:''' We just wanna ask you a question.
Where is everyone?

'''WOMAN:''' The ark.
The evacuation vessel.

'''SYLVIE:''' Something like that would have
enough juice to repower the TemPad.

'''LOKI:''' How do we get there?

'''WOMAN:''' Train station's the edge of town.
But you'll never get a ticket.

'''SYLVIE:''' Come on, let's go.

[''Sylvie and Loki continue on.'']

=== Train station ===
[''At the train station, there's a long line of clamoring people.'']

'''GUARD:''' Quiet down!
Get back!

'''WOMAN IN LINE:''' What's going on?
The ark leaves tonight
and we've been waiting in line for hours.
For hours.

'''LOKI:''' Well, this looks fun.

'''SYLVIE:''' Come on.

'''LOKI:''' We can't fight our way onto that train.

'''SYLVIE:''' Who said anything about fighting?

'''LOKI:''' All your plans involve fighting.

'''SYLVIE:''' Not this one.
I'm going to enchant a guard,
have him lead us through the crowd,
and if anyone gives us any trouble...

'''LOKI:''' Make him start shooting?
And then what, kill every guard
and hijack the train?

'''SYLVIE:''' Whether or not there's a fight
is entirely up to them.

'''LOKI:''' We're doing this one my way.

[''Loki shifts his outfit into a guard uniform.'']

'''LOKI:''' How do I look?

'''SYLVIE:''' Like someone with a shit plan.

'''LOKI:''' It's a great plan.

'''SYLVIE:''' [''Doubtful.''] Hmm.

'''LOKI:''' Just follow my lead.

[''Loki leads her forward.'']

'''WOMAN:''' Why can't we get on?

'''MAN:''' Let us in! Come on!

'''GUARD:''' To Shuroo? This way, sir.

'''MAN 2:''' Let us in! Women and children...

'''WOMAN IN LINE:''' They're only giving tickets out
to the wealthy!
What about us?

[''Crowd continues shouting.'']

'''PRIVATE HUDSON:''' Tickets?

[''The people ahead of Loki and Sylvie hand tickets to the the guard Private Hudson, who checks them and lets them board. Loki tries to continue onto the train with Sylvie.'']

'''PRIVATE HUDSON:''' Whoa! Hey!

'''LOKI:''' Taking this one to Shuroo.

'''PRIVATE HUDSON:''' Okay. And the tickets?

'''LOKI:''' Orders come from the top
to get her on this train.

'''PRIVATE HUDSON:''' [''To another guard, Corporal Hicks''] Sir, this...

[''Sylvie touches Private Hudson, using her magic to enchant him.'']

'''CORPORAL HICKS:''' Everything okay?

'''PRIVATE HUDSON:''' Yeah, everything's fine.
Yeah, I just remembered
that headquarters radioed in
their request for them this morning.

'''CORPORAL HICKS:''' [''Sighs.'']
Okay.

'''LOKI:''' Okay.

[''Loki and Sylvie board the train.'']

'''PRIVATE HUDSON:''' Tickets?

=== Train ===
[''Loki and Sylvie enter the passenger car.'']

'''LOKI:''' Good evening, passengers. Hi.

[''Sylvie takes a seat at a booth.'']

'''LOKI:''' Um, uh, look,
I can't go backwards on a train.

'''SYLVIE:''' Well, I never sit with my back to a door.

'''LOKI:''' What? There are doors on both sides.

'''SYLVIE:''' Oh, just sit down.

[''Loki sighs and sits down.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' FYI, that wasn't even a plan.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, really?

'''SYLVIE:''' Plans have multiple steps.
Dressing as a guard and getting on a train
is just doing a thing.

[''Sylvie yawns.'']

'''LOKI:''' Oh, you a bit tired?
Feel free to, you know, get some rest.

'''SYLVIE:''' [''Grunts.'']
I can't sleep in a place like this.

'''LOKI:''' You can't sleep on a train?

'''SYLVIE:''' No. I can't sleep around
untrustworthy people.

'''LOKI:''' [''Whispers''] Oh, right. That me?

'''SYLVIE:''' But you feel free to take a nap.

'''LOKI:''' Nice try.

'''SYLVIE:''' I'm not gonna waste my time
rooting around for the TemPad
when someone taught you
fairly decent magic.

'''LOKI:''' My mother.

'''SYLVIE:''' [''Scoffs. Pauses.''] What was she like?

'''LOKI:''' She was, um...
A Queen of Asgard.
She was good. Purely decent.

'''SYLVIE:''' [''Scoffs.''] Are you sure she was your mother?

'''LOKI:''' Oh, no, she's not actually. I was adopted.
Is that a bit of a spoiler for you?
Sorry about that.

'''LOKI:''' No, I knew I was adopted.

'''LOKI:''' What? They told you?

'''SYLVIE:''' Yeah. Did they not tell you?

'''LOKI:''' No.
I mean, I mean, they, they did eventually.
Hang on a second.
So, tell... Tell me about your mother.

'''SYLVIE:''' I barely remember her.
Just blips of a dream at this point.

'''LOKI:''' You know, when I was young, she'd do
these little bits of magic for me.
Like turn a flower into a frog
or cast fireworks over the water.
It all seemed impossible.
But she told me that
I'd be able to do it too because...
Because I could do anything.
You wanna see?

[''Loki sets off tiny fireworks over his hand.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' [''Sniffs.''] Not bad.

'''LOKI:''' She was the kinda person
you'd want to believe in you.

'''SYLVIE:''' Sounds like she does.

'''LOKI:''' Well, she did.
So, where'd you learn to do the...
You know, the... Whatever it is?

'''SYLVIE:''' I taught myself.

'''LOKI:''' You taught yourself that magic?

'''SYLVIE:''' Yeah, I did.

'''LOKI:''' What, do you just...
You just go into their minds
and project some sort of illusion?

'''SYLVIE:''' Really it'd be easier if I just... [''reaches for him'']

'''LOKI:''' [''leans back''] Enchanted me and take the TemPad
and leap out the train?
No, thank you.

'''SYLVIE:''' Well then, don't ask.

'''LOKI:''' [''Whispers''] Okay.

'''WAITRESS:''' Champagne?

'''LOKI:''' Ah, yes. Thank you very much.

'''SYLVIE:''' No, I'm good, thanks.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, I'll take hers. Thank you.
Cheers. [''Clinks both glasses together.'']
To the end of the world. [''Takes a drink.'']
A pity the old woman chose to die,
don't you think?

'''SYLVIE:''' She was in love.

'''LOKI:''' She hated him.

'''SYLVIE:''' Maybe love is hate.

'''LOKI:''' Should probably remember that.
[''Conjures paper and a quill.'']
What was that? [''Writing.''] "Love is... Love is hate."

'''SYLVIE:''' Oh, piss off!

[''Loki disappears the paper and quill.'']

'''LOKI:''' So, on the subject of love,
is there a lucky beau waiting for you
at the end of this crusade?

'''SYLVIE:''' Yeah, there is, actually.

'''LOKI:''' Oh.

'''LOKI:''' Managed to maintain quite a serious
long-distance relationship with a postman
whilst running across time from one apocalypse to another.

'''LOKI:''' [''Chuckles.''] And with charm like that,
who could resist you?

'''SYLVIE:''' Well, people are quite willing
in the face of certain doom.

'''LOKI:''' I'm sure they are.

'''SYLVIE:''' It was only ever just to keep me going.
How about you? You're a prince.
Must've been would-be-princesses
or perhaps, another prince.

'''LOKI:''' A bit of both. I suspect the same as you.
But, nothing ever...

'''SYLVIE:''' Real.

'''LOKI:''' Mmm... [''Takes another drink.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Love is mischief, then.

'''LOKI:''' No.
Love is...
uh, something I might have
to have another drink to think about.

[''Loki chuckles and finishes the second drink he took.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' You do realize
we're about to try and hijack
the power source
to a civilization's only hope?

'''LOKI:''' I do.

'''SYLVIE:''' It's not gonna be easy.
We should rest.

'''LOKI:''' All right. You relax your way
and I'll relax mine.

[''After some time, Sylvie wakes where she fell asleep at their table, to the sound of Loki is singing and the whole train car clapping along. Loki is no longer in a guard uniform, but back in his TVA clothes.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''singing in Asgardian'']<br />
...når hun synger hun synger kom hjem,<br />
men tranene danser og fosserne stanser.<br />

'''LOKI & EVERYONE:''' [''singing in English'']<br />
When she sings, she sings come home<br />
When she sings, she sings come home

'''LOKI:''' [''singing in Asgardian'']<br />
Men tranene danser og fossene stanser<br />
når hun synger hun synger kom hjem,<br />
men tranene danser og fosserne stanser

[''Sylvie waves at him for attention. Loki waves back.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Where's your uniform?

[''Loki keeps singing and swings side to side to her.'']

'''LOKI & EVERYONE:''' [''singing in English'']<br />
When she sings, she sings come home<br />
When she sings, she sings come home<br />
When she sings, she sings come home<br />
When she sings, she sings come home

[''Loki shushes everyone. A man stands up and Sylvie watches him leave the train car. Loki leans on the bar, facing Sylvie.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''singing softly'']<br />
I stormsvarte fjell, jeg vandrer alene<br />
Over isbreen tar jeg meg frem<br />
I eplehagen står møyen den vene<br />
og synger “når kommer du hjem?”

[''There's a pause as Loki and Sylvie look at each other. Loki brings the music back to upbeat, clapping with the others in the train car.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''singing'']<br />
Men tranene danser og fossene stanser<br />
når hun synger, hun synger kom hjem<br />
men tranene danser og fossene stanser<br />
When she sings, she sings come home

'''LOKI & EVERYONE:''' [''singing in English'']<br />
When she sings, she sings come home

'''LOKI:''' To Sylvie, everybody!

[''Everyone in the train car cheers.'']

[''Loki downs a drink.'']

'''LOKI:''' Another!

[''He throws the glass down, breaking it. Sylvie gets up and brings him aside.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' You're drunk.

'''LOKI:''' No, I'm just full.
But bear in mind, I'm ''very'' full.
Now, I need you to try this. [''Picks up a small dish for her.'']
It pairs very nicely with the Figgy Port.
Who's got the Figgy Port?
Well you'll just have to take my word
on the Figgy Port, but...

'''SYLVIE:''' Where's your uniform?
We're meant to be laying low.

'''LOKI:''' Nobody cares. It's the end of the world.

'''SYLVIE:''' I think something's happening.

'''LOKI:''' Yes.
Uh, that planet is about to crash into us.

'''SYLVIE:''' Don't be an ass.
I saw some people looking at you weirdly.

'''LOKI:''' What?

[''Loki sets the dish down on the edge of the bar, but he misses and the dish clatters to the floor.'']

'''LOKI:''' When did you get so paranoid?

'''SYLVIE:''' Oh I guess it must have started
when I spent my entire life
running from the omniscient fascists
you work for.

[''Lok sighs and looks down at the fallen dish.'']

'''LOKI:''' It's a shame to let that go to waste.
Hey! Change of subject.
I thought of an answer.

'''SYLVIE:''' To what?

'''LOKI:''' Your question.
Love is a dagger.
[''He conjures a dagger to his hand.'']
It's a weapon
to be wielded far away or up close.
You can see yourself in it.
It's beautiful.
Until it makes you bleed.
But ultimately, when you reach for it...

[''Loki offers the hilt to Sylvie. She reaches to take it, but the dagger disappears.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' It isn't real.

'''LOKI:''' Yeah.

'''SYLVIE:''' Love is an imaginary dagger.

'''LOKI:''' ... It doesn't make sense, does it?

'''SYLVIE:''' No. Terrible metaphor.

'''LOKI:''' Damn. I thought I had something there.

[''The train car doors open. The man who left earlier returns with guards, and he points at Loki.'']

'''MAN:''' That's him.

'''SYLVIE:''' Stay cool.

'''LOKI:''' It's gonna be fine.

'''CORPORAL HICKS:''' Sir, can I see your tickets?

'''LOKI:''' [''Chuckles.''] You again. Hello.
Um, tickets.
Yes, of course. Here they are.

[''Loki lifts his hand, and small fireworks burst over his open palm.'']

'''LOKI:''' Oops.
Still, it looks lovely, doesn't it?

[''Corporal Hicks grabs Loki's arm to apprehend him.'']

'''LOKI:''' Look, is this really necessary?
There is a simple explanation... Hey.

[''They start to fight.'']

'''GUARD:''' Get out of the way.

[''The other occupants of the car flee.'']

[''Sylvie begins fighting the other two guards. Loki blasts one with his magic. Sylvie takes down one, but the other grabs her around the throat. Loki pulls out a dagger, aims, and throws. It lands in the wall beside her.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Awful throw.

[''Loki turns to one of the guards who's getting back up.'']

'''LOKI:''' Oh, will you stop it?

[''They fight. Loki kicks him, and he crashes out of the train window.'']

'''LOKI:''' Bye.

[''Sylvie gets out of the hold of the guard. Two guards grab Loki and throw him out through the shattered window.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' TemPad.

[''Sylvie grabs her sword, and runs past the guards and jumps out the window after Loki.'']

=== Outside the train ===
[''Loki gets up and walks up to Sylvie, who's getting up. The train speeds away.'']

'''LOKI:''' Well, that's not ideal.

[''Sylvie pulls her sword on Loki.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Give me the TemPad.

'''LOKI:''' All right all right. All right. Okay.

[''Loki conjures the TemPad. It's broken and smoking.'']

'''LOKI:''' Well, I did take quite the tumble.

'''SYLVIE:''' You asshole. You killed us.

'''LOKI:''' Maybe we can fix it. Okay? Um...

[''The TemPad falls apart in his hands.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' You're not a serious man.

'''LOKI:''' You're right. I'm a god.

'''SYLVIE:''' You're a clown.
You got drunk on the train.

'''LOKI:''' I'm hedonistic. That's what I do.

'''SYLVIE:''' I'm hedonistic.
A lot more than you, I assure you.
But never at the expense of the mission.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, the mission? The mission?
What, your glorious purpose?
Give me a break. You can't beat them.

[''Sylvie walks away. Power glows in her hands as she screams, and release an energy blast. She sits on the edge of a meteor crater with a sigh.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''to himself''] Okay.

[''Loki walks over and sits next to her.'']

'''LOKI:''' Did the, uh, scream make you feel better?

'''SYLVIE:''' Yes, it did.
You should try it sometime.

'''LOKI:''' [''Sighs.''] What now?

'''SYLVIE:''' I don't know. You broke the TemPad.

'''LOKI:''' Well...

'''SYLVIE:''' And that planet is about to crash into us.

'''LOKI:''' Well, yes, but...

'''SYLVIE:''' Yes, but what?

'''LOKI:''' Well, the entire moon is destroyed, right?

'''SYLVIE:''' Yep. And everyone on it is killed.

'''LOKI:''' Including us.

'''SYLVIE:''' Yes, including us.

'''LOKI:''' What about the ark?

'''SYLVIE:''' The ark never leaves
because it's destroyed.

'''LOKI:''' Never had us on it.

'''SYLVIE:''' [''Scoffs.'']
So what? We hijack the ark
and make sure it gets off this moon?

'''LOKI:''' I mean, sounds like a good idea to me.

'''SYLVIE:''' Okay.

[''Sylvie gets up and starts walking.'']

'''LOKI:''' Really?

[''Loki gets up after her.'']

=== Walking to to Shuroo ===
[''They approach the city Shuroo in the distance.'']

'''LOKI:''' You know, I don't think
I've ever walked this much in my life.

'''SYLVIE:''' That's a pretty good life.

'''LOKI:''' Well, you're lucky you missed it.
Here's an idea. What if you enchanted me
and you could walk for both of us?
I take a nap in my subconscious,
and then you could just wake me
when we arrive. Yeah?

'''SYLVIE:''' Yeah, that's not how enchantment works.

'''LOKI:''' All right, how does it work?

'''SYLVIE:''' Doesn't matter.

'''LOKI:''' You know, I feel like
I've told you so much about me.
I really don't know
the first thing about you.

'''SYLVIE:''' Thanks for the tactical advantage.

'''LOKI:''' Ah, so, you want to use
that tactical advantage to kill me
when the TVA shows up.

'''SYLVIE:''' Worried, are you?

'''LOKI:''' I just need to know if I can trust you.

'''SYLVIE:''' Okay, fine.
You want to know how enchantment works.
I have to make physical contact
and then grab hold of their mind.

'''LOKI:''' How?

'''SYLVIE:''' It depends on the mind.
Most are easy
and I can overtake them instantly.
Others, the stronger ones, it gets tricky.
I'm in control, but they're there, too.
In order to preserve the connection,
I have to create a fantasy
from their memories.

'''LOKI:''' And you call me a magician.

'''SYLVIE:''' That young soldier from the TVA,
her mind was messed up.
Everything clouded.
I had to pull a memory
from hundreds of years prior,
before she even fought for them.

'''LOKI:''' What? What'd you say?
Before she joined the TVA?

'''SYLVIE:''' Yeah. She was just
a regular person on Earth.

'''LOKI:''' A regular person?

'''SYLVIE:''' Loved margaritas.

'''LOKI:''' I was told that
everyone who works for the TVA
was created by the Time-Keepers.

'''SYLVIE:''' That's ridiculous.
They're all Variants, just like us.

'''LOKI:''' They don't know that.

'''ANNOUNCER:''' All ticketed passengers, report to...

'''SYLVIE:''' That's our ride.

'''ANNOUNCER:''' Ten minutes until launch.

=== Shuroo ===
'''ANNOUNCER:''' Final boarding call.

'''SYLVIE:''' Do we trust each other?

'''LOKI:''' We do and you can.

[''They enter the city to a mass of clamoring people. The ark is in the distance ahead of them.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Good. Because this is gonna suck.

[''They hurry forward through the crowd.'']

'''GUARD:''' Remain calm. We're now at capacity.
Please return to your homes.
Stand back!

'''CROWD:''' [''Chanting''] Let us on!
Let us on!

'''ANNOUNCER:''' Five minutes until launch.

'''LOKI:''' They're gonna let these people die.

'''ANNOUNCER:''' Five minutes until launch.

'''SYLVIE:''' We have to get on that ark
and make sure it takes off.

'''LOKI:''' How?

'''SYLVIE:''' We go around.

'''LOKI:''' Okay.

[''They run together through the shouting people.'']

'''GUARD:''' Return to your homes.

[''People clamoring, a man screams.'']

'''GUARD:''' Get back!
Stand back!

[''There's an explosive sound overhead as the approaching planet breaks apart. Meteors shoot down. One lands nearby. People run and scream, and Loki and Sylvie run forward. A meteor lands ahead of them, throwing them back. They pull each other up and run for cover.'']

'''LOKI:''' You okay?

'''SYLVIE:''' Yeah.

[''A guard grabs at Sylvie, pulling her cloak from her. Loki blasts another guard with magic.'']

'''GUARD:''' Hold it! Stop right there.

[''They fight past the guards.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Just go.

[''They run outside.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Over here!

[''Man screams.'']

'''MAN 2:''' You're gonna be okay.

[''A woman runs past.'']

'''MAN 3:''' No! No, wait!

[''Loki and Sylvie run as a communication tower falls. Explosions all around.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Run!

[''They run. A large portion of a building falls toward them.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Watch out!

'''LOKI:''' I've got it!

[''Loki stops the falling tower with magic, and pushes it back.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Come on. Let's go!

'''LOKI:''' We can still make it!

[''They fight more guards as they approach the gates to reach the ark just ahead.'']

'''LOKI:''' Sylvie, come on!

[''They get past the guards and run toward the gate. The ark, just ahead, is struck by a large meteor from the planet, and is destroyed. Loki and Sylvie stop and stare ahead at it. The street around them has quieted. Sylvie turns and walks away, as Loki continues to stand there and stare ahead.'']

[''Dark Moon performed by Bonnie Guitar begins. End credits.'']

'''LOKI:''' So, you're part of the TVA's
courageous and dedicated workforce?

'''MOBIUS:''' Yes.

'''LOKI:''' You were created by the Time-Keepers?

'''MOBIUS:''' Correct.

[''Loki laughs.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' You're not the only analyst
working for me.

'''MOBIUS:''' But, would you say,
maybe, I'm your favorite one?

'''LOKI:''' Enchantment is a clever trick.

'''SYLVIE:''' I have to create a fantasy
from their memories.
That young soldier from the TVA,
she was just a regular person on Earth.

'''SYLVIE:''' Of all of the apocalypses
saved on that TemPad, this is the worst!
No one makes it off here!

'''LOKI:''' How long do we have?

'''SYLVIE:''' Twelve hours or so.
Things down here are only gonna get worse.

'''LOKI:''' To the end of the world.

[''Marvel studios logo'']

== Asgard ==
[''Alone in a room, Young Sylvie plays with toys.'']

'''YOUNG SYLVIE:'''
... dragon swoops towards the palace,
the Valkyrie flies over,
and defeats the dragon, and saves Asgard.

[''A timedoor opens behind her. Ravonna, a Hunter, steps through with Minutemen. She checks her TemPad.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' There's our Variant.

[''The Minutemen apprehend Sylvie.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' On the authority of the Time-Keepers,
I hereby arrest you for crimes
against the Sacred Timeline.
Reset it.

'''YOUNG SYLVIE:''' Wait!

[''Ravonna pulls Sylvie through the timedoor. The Minutemen set a reset charge. As it activates, it disintegrates Sylvie's toys.'']

== TVA past ==
[''Ravonna and Sylvie step through the Timedoor into the TVA. Another man struggles.'']

'''MAN:''' No! No!

'''YOUNG SYLVIE:''' Help him!

[''Ravonna pulls Sylvie on. Sylvie is processed, dressed in processing clothes, sign the papers, gets her temporal aura pictured. Ravonna escorts her into the courtroom.'']

'''JUDGE:''' Next case!

[''As Ravonna leads Sylvie forward, Sylvie bites her and grabs the TemPad.'']

'''JUDGE:''' Next case!

'''RAVONNA:''' Right here!

[''Sylvie opens a Timedoor and escapes.'']

[''In the present, Ravonna takes a deep breath and steps out of the gold elevators into the Time-Keepers' chambers.'']

[''Opening theme'']

== TVA present ==
[''Ravonna exits the elevators back in the TVA hallway where Mobius waits.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' What'd they say? Are you okay?

'''RAVONNA:''' No, no, Mobius. I'm not.
Under the best of circumstances,
it's jarring to stand
before the Time-Keepers.
And this is not the best of circumstances.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah, but they can't blame you.

'''RAVONNA:''' They can and do.
The Variant was right here.
What if she got to the Time-Keepers?

'''MOBIUS:''' I know. But she didn't.

'''RAVONNA:''' No. But she got away.
Along with the Variant that
I got you permission to bring in here.
Do you have any idea how impossible it is
to keep the timeline stable?
The Time-Keepers are all that stand
between us and full-scale calamity.

'''MOBIUS:''' And I'm glad they're on our side.
But if they want me
to find Loki and the Variant,
[''whispers''] I need access to Hunter C-20.

'''RAVONNA:''' I'm sorry, but that's impossible.

'''MOBIUS:''' Look, when we found her,
she kept saying, "It's real. It's real."
Over and over.
I need to find out what that meant
and what else she saw
when she was with the Variant.
Look, I know there's protocol,
but she could have information...

'''RAVONNA:''' She's dead, Mobius!

'''MOBIUS:''' What? How?

'''RAVONNA:''' The Variant, she enchanted C-20,
scrambled her mind.

'''MOBIUS:''' I don't get it. She seemed okay.
She seemed fine.

'''RAVONNA:''' At first, yes.
But by the time she got in here,
she could barely speak.
The decline was steeper after that.

'''MOBIUS:''' I didn't know. What...

'''RAVONNA:''' Nobody does.
We don't want people to panic.
Can I trust you to keep that between us?

'''MOBIUS:''' Of course. Yes.
I'm sorry.

'''RAVONNA:''' Every moment those Variants are out there,
we're all in danger.
Find them!

== Lamentis-1 / TVA ==
=== Lamentis-1 ===
[''Meteors crash down all around on the moon. People cry out. Sylvie sits on a stone, watching the planet get closer. Loki walks over and sits beside her.'']

'''LOKI:''' I'm sorry.

'''SYLVIE:''' I remember Asgard.
Not much, but I remember.
My home, my people, my life.
The universe wants to break free,
so it manifests chaos.
Like me being born
the Goddess of Mischief.
And as soon as that created a big enough
detour from the Sacred Timeline,
the TVA showed up, erased my reality,
and took me prisoner.
I was just a child.
I escaped.
Stole a TemPad and I ran for a long,
long time, which really sucked.
Everywhere and every-when I went,
it caused a nexus event.
Sent up a smoke flare.
Because I'm not supposed to exist.
Until, eventually,
I figured out where to hide.
And so that's where I grew up,
the ends of a thousand worlds.
Now... that's where I'll die.

=== TVA ===
'''ANALYST 1:''' There's nothing, sir.

'''MOBIUS:''' Even with
the magnified nexus threshold?
That one should be setting off alarms
if somebody steps on the wrong leaf.

'''ANALYST 2:''' Wherever they are,
I'm not sure anything survives.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah. Don't underestimate them.
[''To Hunter B-15.''] You see anything down at Roxxcart?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' They're gone.
Leaping across time,
plotting their next massacre.
Any news on C-20?

'''MOBIUS:''' No.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' We need to find them.

'''MOBIUS:''' We will.

=== Lamentis-1 ===
[''Massive portions of the planet begin breaking apart and crashing onto the moon.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Not long now.
Do you think that what makes a Loki a Loki
is the fact that we're destined to lose?

'''LOKI:''' No.
We may lose.
Sometimes painfully.
But we don't die.
We survive.
I mean, you did.
You were just a child
when the TVA took you,
but you nearly took down the organization
that claims to govern the order of time.
You did it on your own.
You ran rings around them. You're amazing!

[''Sylvie lays her hand on his forearm. Loki looks down at her touch.'']

=== TVA ===
'''ANALYST 2:''' We've got something.

[''On the screen of the timeline, a branch begins to grow: Lamentis 1.'']

'''ANALYST 1:''' Temporal lock.

=== Lamentis-1 ===
[''Loki looks up at Sylvie. A massive meteor crashes before them and the shockwave comes their way. Loki and Sylvie take each others' hand as they look on. They turn back to each other. Sylvie smiles.'']

=== TVA ===
'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, that's not someone
stepping on the wrong leaf.
You ever seen a branch like that?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' No.

=== Lamentis-1 ===
[''Timedoors open behind Loki and Sylvie. They both stand and face them.'']

== TVA ==
[''Loki and Sylvie are both collared and being escorted by Minutemen and Mobius through the TVA. Sylvie is led down a different hallway, and she looks back at Loki as they're pulled apart.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Well?

'''LOKI:''' Well, what?

'''MOBIUS:''' I know you got some quip
you're dyin' to say.

'''LOKI:''' Oh I don't have a quip.
I've got nothing to say.

'''MOBIUS:''' Come on.

'''LOKI:''' By the way, I should have an equal amount
of security. This is insulting!

'''MOBIUS:''' You just can't help yourself.

'''LOKI:''' You betrayed me!

'''MOBIUS:''' You betrayed me!

'''LOKI:''' Oh grow up!

'''MOBIUS:''' You grow up.

[''They enter Time Theater 5.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' You know, it occurred to me that
you're not really the God of Mischief.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, here it comes.
The folksy, dopey insult
from the folksy dope.
What am I? The God of Self-Sabotage, yeah?
The God of Back-Stabbing?

'''MOBIUS:''' Just kind of an asshole and a bad friend.
Yeah, chew on that for a little bit.
All right. It's ready.

[''A red-framed Timedoor opens before him.'']

'''LOKI:''' What is this?

'''MOBIUS:''' You'll see.

'''LOKI:''' Mobius!

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay. No, no, no, let him,
one last desperate trick
from the desperate trickster. Go ahead.

'''LOKI:''' The TVA is lying to you.

'''MOBIUS:''' Put him in.

'''LOKI:''' No. 

[''Loki struggles but is pushed through the door.'']

== Time Cell ==

'''LOKI:''' What?
[''Chuckles.'']
Seriously?

[''Sif steps out and holds up a handful of her cut hair.'']

'''SIF:''' You.

'''LOKI:''' Sif!

'''SIF:''' You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.
You did this.

'''LOKI:''' What?

[''Sif strikes his face.'']

'''LOKI:''' Ow.

'''SIF:''' I hope you know you deserve to be alone
and you always will be.

'''LOKI:''' All right.
A bad memory prison? How quaint.

[''Sif knees him and punches him, knocking him to the ground. She walks past him and leaves.'']

'''LOKI:''' Ow!
Some punishment. [''Grunts as he stands.'']
I remember exactly what I did after that.
I went and had a nice, hot bath
and a glass of wine,
and I never thought about it again,
because it was just a bit of fun.

'''SIF:''' You.

'''LOKI:''' Huh?

[''Loki turns to see Sif enter, just as she did before.'']

'''SIF:''' You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.
You did this.

'''LOKI:''' Hang on. 

[''Sif strikes his face.'']

'''LOKI:''' Ow.

'''SIF:''' I hope you know you deserve to be alone
and you always will be.

'''LOKI:''' Just...

[''Sif knees him and punches him, knocking him to the ground. She walks past him and leaves.'']

[''Loki groans loudly. He stands.'']

'''LOKI:''' Time loops. How lovely.

'''SIF:''' You.
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.

'''LOKI:''' Okay. Okay, Sif. Hang on.

[''Sif strikes his face.'']

'''SIF:''' No, you hear this.
You deserve to be alone...

'''LOKI:''' And I always will be.
All right, I get it.
Listen. You are a reconstruction
of a past event
created by the organization
that controls all of time.
So you need to trust me
and you need to help me escape. Yeah?
Okay, good.

[''Sif knees him and punches him, knocking him to the ground. She walks past him and leaves.'']

'''SIF:''' Pathetic.

== Ravonna's office ==
[''Mobius knocks at the door and enters.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Hey.

[''Ravonna smiles.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Shouldn't you be interrogating
the Loki Variant?

'''MOBIUS:''' He's softening in the Time Cell,
but while he marinates, I thought
maybe I'd interview the other Variant.

'''RAVONNA:''' Oh, no. Just stick with your Loki
and figure out what that nexus spike was.

'''MOBIUS:''' I know, but I think I can get there faster
if I work 'em both together.
Remember you said we have a part to play,
and this is the part I play...

'''RAVONNA:''' Absolutely not. She's just too dangerous.

'''MOBIUS:''' Too dangerous? Come on, Ravonna.
This is what I do.

'''RAVONNA:''' And this is what I do.
Nobody speaks with that Variant.

'''MOBIUS:''' I mean, if there's a mastermind here,
I don't think it's Loki.

'''RAVONNA:''' Good.
Then he should be the easiest to break.
Work your Loki and figure out
what caused that spike.
Time-Keepers are watching, Mobius.

'''MOBIUS:''' They're always watching.
"Work your Loki, work your Loki."
That ought to be my mantra.

[''Mobius leaves.'']

== Hallway ==
[''Outside Time Theater 47.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' [''To Minutemen.''] You all right?

[''Mobius walks over.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Is she in there?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Mm-hmm.

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Scoffs.'']
They don't go gently, do they?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Aren't you supposed to be
interrogating your Variant pet?

'''MOBIUS:''' Just stretching my legs.
You know, we brought in Kree,
Titans, vampires.
Why is it the two orphan demigods
are such a pain in the ass?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' And yet it was your idea
to bring in another one.

'''MOBIUS:''' I'm happy to share credit for that idea.

[''Mobius starts to leave.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Mobius?
Did Loki say anything
while you were in there?

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah. He said the TVA is lying to me.
Why?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Just doing my job.

== Time cell ==
[''Loki sits on the ground.'']

'''SIF:''' You.

[''Loki sighs.'']

'''SIF:''' You conniving, craven...

'''LOKI:''' Sif. Sif.

'''SIF:''' ...pathetic worm.

'''LOKI:''' Please, please, no more.
Please, I beg you.
I'm a horrible person.
I get it. I really am.
I cut off your hair
because I thought it'd be funny.
And it's not.
Uh...
I crave attention...
because I'm...
[''Sighs.'']
I'm a... I'm a narcissist.
And I suppose it's...
It's because I'm scared of being alone.

[''After a moment, Sif offers him a hand up. Loki takes it and stands.'']

'''SIF:''' You are alone and you always will be.

[''Sif walks past him and leaves. Mobius walks in.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, Loki.
You ready to talk?

== Time Theater 5 ==
'''LOKI:''' Fancy technology.
Threatening interrogation tactics.
Seems you and I are in a loop of our own.

'''MOBIUS:''' Well, there's been a lot of water
under the bridge since then.

'''LOKI:''' Certainly has.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, you said the TVA is lying to me.
Go ahead.
Or is that just a cockroach's
survival mechanism kicking in?

'''LOKI:''' Let me out of this place,
stop beating me up, and I'll tell you.

'''MOBIUS:''' Cockroach. Got it.
How long have you been
working for the Variant?

'''LOKI:''' Me? Working for her? Please.

'''MOBIUS:''' If you're not working for the Variant,
what is it? You're partners?

'''LOKI:''' Absolutely not.
She's difficult and irritating,
and she tries to hit me all the time.
No. Not partners, no.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah, I guess you don't do partners.
Unless, of course, it benefits you,
and you intend to betray them
at some point.

'''LOKI:''' It was a means to an end, Mobius.
Welcome to the real world.
Down there, we're awful to one another
to get what we want.

'''MOBIUS:''' Now I gotta have a prince tell me
how the real world works?
Why don't you just tell me what caused
the nexus event on Lamentis?

'''LOKI:''' Let me say this again.
I'm not going to tell you
just so you can turn around
immediately afterwards and prune me.

'''MOBIUS:''' I guess we've reached a dead end then.

'''LOKI:''' Okay, it's over.

'''MOBIUS:''' I'm going to miss
these little tete-a-tetes.

'''LOKI:''' Me, too.

'''MOBIUS:''' One guy playing checkers, you,
old Mobius playing chess,
but, yeah, give my regards to Lady Sif.

'''LOKI:''' What... No. What? No, no, no.
Please, not...
Well, just wait, wait, wait.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah?

'''LOKI:''' Of course it was me
pulling the strings all along.
She came to me on Asgard a long time ago
and then she took me
to one of her apocalypses
and that's where
we hatched our plan together.

'''MOBIUS:''' Which is?

'''LOKI:''' Coming along very nicely, thank you.

'''MOBIUS:''' And the Variant?

'''LOKI:''' Doesn't matter. She's a pawn.
Something very, very big is gonna happen.
And when it does, I'll dispose of her.

'''MOBIUS:''' Well, we saved you the trouble there.
She's already been pruned.
So assume I do set you free...

'''LOKI:''' Hang on, wait.
What'd you just say?

'''MOBIUS:''' What? Assume I do set you free.

'''LOKI:''' The Variant. She's gone?

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah. Not before she took out two of ours.
Yeah, she was going
to her Time Cell, broke free.
Hunter B-15 stepped in, popped her.
So you might want to fire off
a thank you note to Hunter B-15,
because it looks like
you're the superior Loki.
I would've bet on her,
but that's what makes a horse race.

[''Loki leans back. Shrugs.'']

'''LOKI:''' Good riddance.

[''Loki smiles. Mobius chuckles.'']

'''LOKI:''' What's so funny?

'''MOBIUS:''' Come on.
Look at your eyes. You like her.

'''LOKI:''' What?

'''MOBIUS:''' You like her. Does she like you?

'''LOKI:''' Was she pruned?

'''MOBIUS:''' I mean, no wonder you have no clue
what caused the nexus event
on Lamentis.
Both of you were just swooning over each other.

'''LOKI:''' Mobius. Tell me the truth.

'''MOBIUS:''' It's the apocalypse.
Two Variants of the same being,
especially you, forming this kind of sick,
twisted romantic relationship.
That's pure chaos.
That could break reality.
It's breaking my reality right now.
What a incredible seismic narcissist.
You fell for yourself.

'''LOKI:''' Her name was Sylvie.

'''MOBIUS:''' Ah, Sylvie.
Lovely.
How do you spell that?
Is that with an I-E or just an I?

'''LOKI:''' Is she alive?

'''MOBIUS:''' For now.

[''Loki sighs.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' And was infiltrating the TVA,
was that always sort of the grand plan?

'''LOKI:''' Our interests are aligned.

'''MOBIUS:''' Overthrowing the Time-Keepers?

'''LOKI:''' Maybe they need to be overthrown.

'''MOBIUS:''' I ought to box your ears.

'''LOKI:''' Mobius, listen.
If what Sylvie told me about this place
is true, it affects all of us.

'''MOBIUS:''' Oh here we go. Now, you've already told me
about 50 lies in the past 10 minutes.

'''LOKI:''' I'm not lying.

'''MOBIUS:''' And now, I'm supposed
to believe your terrorist girlfriend.

'''LOKI:''' I'm telling you the truth.
She's not my girlfriend.

'''MOBIUS:''' Whatever you want to call her.
What, your female self that
you have some demented crush on...

'''LOKI:''' You're all Variants!
Everyone who works at the TVA.
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.
They kidnapped you from the timeline,
and erased your memories.
Memories she can access
through enchantment.
So before this, you had a past,
maybe you had a family, a life.

'''MOBIUS:''' Nice try.
That was good. You two, what a pair!
Gosh! Unbelievable. Wherever you go,
it's just death, destruction,
the literal ends of worlds.
Well, I'm gonna have
to close this case now,
'cause I don't need you anymore.
Yeah, or as you might say,
our interests are no longer aligned.

[''Minutemen pull Loki to his feet.'']

'''LOKI:''' You know, of all the liars in this place,
and there are a great many,
you're the biggest.

'''MOBIUS:''' Why? 'Cause I lied about your girlfriend?

'''LOKI:''' Oh, no. That I can respect.
I mean, the lies you tell yourself.

[''The door to the Time Cell opens and Loki goes through.'']

== Time Theater 47 ==
[''Hunter B-15 stands in the hallway. She breathes deeply. She looks at a poster on the wall: "Did you get them all? Verify through deletion." She pulls out her pruning stick and activates it. She walks to the door of Time Theater 47.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Open the door.

[''Hunter B-15 enters.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Hello... Oh, I don't know.
Your name's a number.
Can't read it from here.

[''Hunter B-15 powers down her weapon and opens a Timedoor.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Come with me.

== Ravonna's office ==
[''Theremin music plays. Ravonna signs a page and turns it to Mobius.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Mobius?

'''MOBIUS:''' Oh, yeah.

'''RAVONNA:''' You okay?

[''Mobius signs.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Yep, I'm good.

'''RAVONNA:''' Case closed.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yes.

'''RAVONNA:''' Cheers.

'''MOBIUS:''' Cheers.

'''RAVONNA:''' To putting all this behind us.

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Sighs''] Amen.

'''RAVONNA:''' If you could go anywhere, anytime,
where would it be?

'''MOBIUS:''' I can go anywhere, anytime.

'''RAVONNA:''' You know what I mean.

'''MOBIUS:''' Why wouldn't you let me
interrogate Sylvie?

'''RAVONNA:''' Sylvie?

'''MOBIUS:''' The Variant, that's what Loki calls her.
Why wouldn't you let me,
you know, question her?

'''RAVONNA:''' I told you,
we couldn't risk her escaping again.

'''MOBIUS:''' She wouldn't have escaped.

'''RAVONNA:''' The other Variant got away during
your first interrogation, didn't he?

'''MOBIUS:''' Ouch. [''Chuckles.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Come on. Anywhere and anytime
on the timeline. Where'd you go?

'''MOBIUS:''' I like being here now, with you,
doing the work.

'''RAVONNA:''' Fine.
I received word from the Time-Keepers.
They want to personally oversee
the Variant's pruning.
And they want you there, too.

'''MOBIUS:''' It's about time. Great.
When, when did you first notice
what was going on with C-20?

'''RAVONNA:''' Mobius, what is going on with you?

'''MOBIUS:''' Nothing.

'''RAVONNA:''' We did it.

'''MOBIUS:''' I know.

'''RAVONNA:''' The Time-Keepers are happy. Mission accomplished.

'''MOBIUS:''' It's great.
Mission accomplished.
It was just that she seemed fine when I...
When I saw her.
I mean, a little freaked, but fine.

'''RAVONNA:''' Well, she quickly wasn't fine.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay.

'''RAVONNA:''' Okay.
C-20? The Variant?
All these questions,
what are you getting at?

'''MOBIUS:''' I don't know. I...
Something just seems a little off.

'''RAVONNA:''' Fine. You want the truth?
I'm trying to protect you.
Would you normally interview
someone like that? Yeah.
But the Variant scares the hell out of me,
and I didn't want to see
anything happen to you.
C-20 lost her mind.
She couldn't even form words by the end.
I just couldn't deal with that
happening to you or anyone else.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah, if it's the truth.

'''RAVONNA:''' You've been spending
too much time with Lokis.

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Chuckles''] Yeah.
I definitely have been
spending too much time with Lokis.

'''RAVONNA:''' What we do here matters.

'''MOBIUS:''' I know.

'''RAVONNA:''' When we're out there fighting
for the fate of the Sacred Timeline
we're also fighting for this. For us.
Friends against time, allies to the end.
You've seen all of existence, same as me.
So, you know,
friendship like ours is uncommon.
And worth fighting for.
Same as the Sacred Timeline.

'''MOBIUS:''' It was a good speech.

'''RAVONNA:''' Thank you.

'''MOBIUS:''' I knew I was your favorite analyst.
Was that so hard to admit?
What are you gonna do with that trophy?

'''RAVONNA:''' Oh!

'''MOBIUS:''' Where's that gonna go?

'''RAVONNA:''' You're right.
Let's see.

[''Ravonna picks up Sylvie's sword and takes it to the shelves of her tophies. While her back is turned to him, Mobius swaps his TemPad with hers.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Uh...
How's that?

'''MOBIUS:''' Looks perfect.
You're running out of room there.
All right, I will see you later on.

'''RAVONNA:''' One drink?

'''MOBIUS:''' I had two, didn't I?

'''RAVONNA:''' Mobius!
This is a career case.
You sure you're okay?

'''MOBIUS:''' I'm just exhausted,
dealing with all these Lokis.

'''RAVONNA:''' Fair enough.
Let's finish this.

'''MOBIUS:''' For all time.

'''RAVONNA:''' Always.

'''MOBIUS:''' I'll see you up there.
Thanks for the drink.

== Roxxcart 2050 ==
[''Hunter B-15 and Sylvie step out of a Timedoor into the parking lot of Roxxcart in Haven Hills, Alabama.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Fine. You wanted a fair fight.
I respect that.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' When you were in my head, I saw something.
What did you do to me?

'''SYLVIE:''' I showed you your life before the TVA.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' That's a trick. It's a deception.

'''SYLVIE:''' No, it's not.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' I was created by the Time-Keepers.

'''SYLVIE:''' No. I can't create memories.
I can only use what's already there.
The Time-Keepers took your lives from you.
From all of you.
You're Variants.
We're the same.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Show me.

[''Hunter B-15 holds out her hand. Sylvie takes it and green magic shines in their grasp, and along Hunter B-15's temples. Hunter B-15 breathes shakily. The connection ends.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' I looked happy.

[''Sylvie nods.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' What now?

[''Thunder rumbles.'']

== Archives ==
[''Mobius walks between the stacks in the archives and pulls out Ravonna's TemPad. He runs a search on Hunter C-20. Her status is "deceased". He accesses a classified video file on the Mission Debrief for the events of Haven Hills, Alabama on March 15, 2050.'']

'''HUNTER C-20:''' You're not hearing me. I was there.
This was real, what I saw.
This is a place that I've been.
This wasn't the TVA. This was a memory.
I lived down there. I went to that bar.
I had friends.
I had a whole life on the Sacred Timeline.

'''INTERROGATOR:''' Calm down.

'''HUNTER C-20:''' "Calm down"? I'm a Variant.
So are you.
So is every single person in this place.

'''INTERROGATOR:''' I'm ending this.

[''Mobius pauses the video and zooms in on the interrogator - it's Ravonna.'']

== Time Cell ==
'''LOKI:''' I've heard it once,
I've heard it a thousand times.
"You. You conniving, craven,
pathetic worm. You did this."
Right?

[''Mobius steps through a Timedoor.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' What are you doing?

'''LOKI:''' Passing the time.

'''MOBIUS:''' Do you care about this Variant?

'''LOKI:''' Sylvie? I'm not sure
if "care" is the right word.

'''MOBIUS:''' Shut up.

'''LOKI:''' I think we've covered this back in there.

'''MOBIUS:''' Shut up!
Do you really think
you deserve to be alone?
[''Pause.''] Loki!

'''LOKI:''' You told me to shut up.

'''MOBIUS:''' Do you believe
you deserve to be alone?

'''LOKI:''' I don't know.

'''MOBIUS:''' Then you better figure it out quick,
because the nexus event
the two of you caused,
I think whatever that connection is,
can bring this whole place down.
So we better understand...

'''LOKI:''' "We"?

'''MOBIUS:''' Do you swear she didn't implant
those memories in Hunter C-20?

'''LOKI:''' Mobius, no. I believe her.

'''MOBIUS:''' So, I just have to trust
the word of two Lokis?

'''LOKI:''' How about the word of a friend?

'''MOBIUS:''' You were right, about the TVA.
You were right from the beginning.
And if you wanna save her,
you need to trust me.
Can we do that?

'''LOKI:''' Yes.

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay.
You could be whoever,
whatever you wanna be,
even someone good.
I mean, just in case
anyone ever told you different.

[''Loki smiles and they exit through the Timedoor.'']

== Time Theater 5 ==
[''Mobius and Loki enter through the Timedoor. Ravonna and four Minutemen are waiting.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' I think you have something of mine.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah, I got all the way down there
before I even realized I picked up yours.

[''Mobius pulls out the TemPad and hands it to a Minuteman.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' What's going on?

[''Ravonna doesn't respond. The Minuteman hands her the TemPad.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' What's the problem, Ravonna?

[''Ravonna doesn't answer.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' You know where I'd go
if I could go anywhere?
Wherever it is I'm really from.
Yeah, wherever I had a life
before the TVA came along.
Maybe I had a jet ski.
That's what I'd like to do.
Just riding around on my jet ski.

'''RAVONNA:''' Prune him.

[''The Minuteman prunes Mobius, who screams as he disintegrates. Loki gasps. The Minutement apprehend Loki and escort him out.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Wait for me at the elevator.

== Time Theater 47 ==
[''Ravonna enters Time Theater 47. Sylvie is sitting there with wet clothes and hair.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Who was in here with her?

'''MINUTEMAN:''' Sorry, ma'am, B-15 insisted.

'''RAVONNA:''' Put out an alert for Hunter B-15.
She too has been compromised
by the Variant.

== Elevator ==
[''Sylvie is escorted by Minuteman out to the hallway before the elevators, next to Loki.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' [''Whispers to Loki''] You okay?

[''Loki looks down.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' I've got them from here.

[''Elevator doors open. Ravonna, Loki, and Sylvie enter the elevator.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Do you remember me?

'''RAVONNA:''' I do.
What do you wanna say to me, Variant?

'''SYLVIE:''' What was my nexus event?
Why did you bring me in?

'''RAVONNA:''' What does it matter?

'''SYLVIE:''' It was enough to take my life from me,
lead to all of this.
Must have been important.
So, what was it?

'''RAVONNA:''' I don't remember.

[''The elevator doors open, revealing the chamber of the Time-Keepers.'']

== Time-Keepers ==
[''Loki, Sylvie, and Ravonna walk forward. The three Time-Keepers are seated on a dais above them, and four guards stand in the room.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Gracious Time-Keepers,
as promised, the Variants.

'''TIME-KEEPER 1:''' After all your struggle,
at last, you've arrived before us.

'''TIME-KEEPER 2:''' What do you have to say for yourselves
before you meet your end, Variants?

'''LOKI:''' Is that the only reason
you brought us here?
To kill us?
I've lost track of the number of times
I've been killed, so go ahead.
Do your worst.

'''TIME-KEEPER 3:''' You and your bravado
are no threat to us, Variant.

'''SYLVIE:''' Oh, no, I don't think you believe that.
I think...

[''Sylvie steps forward, but Ravonna uses the Time-Twister to bring her back.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' I think you're scared.

'''TIME-KEEPER 1:''' No, Variant. You're nothing
but a cosmic disappointment.
Delete them.

'''SYLVIE:''' No, I'm not done with you yet.

[''Sylvie steps forward again, but Ravonna again uses the Time-Twister to try to pull her back, and Sylvie shifts, but it doesn't work as it did before. Ravonna looks confused. The elevator doors open and Hunter B-15 steps out. She holds up a Time-Twister, and the collars unlock from Sylvie and Loki, freeing them.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' For all time. Always.

[''Hunter B-15 tosses a sword to Sylvie. The two guards by the doors turn to fight Hunter B-15. Loki and Sylvie move back-to-back. The guards take down Hunter B-15.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Protect the Time-Keepers!

[''The four guards face Loki and Sylvie. They begin to fight.'']

'''LOKI:''' A little help here?

'''SYLVIE:''' Here.

[''Sylvie throws Loki the sword. They continue fighting.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Come on.

[''Sylvie takes down one guard and stabs the other. She faces Ravonna, who picks up a pruning stick.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' This time I finish the job.

[''They fight. Sylvie knocks Ravonna down. Loki finishes the other two guards. Loki hands the sword back to Sylvie.'']

'''TIME-KEEPER 1:''' You're a child
of the Time-Keepers too, Sylvie.
We can talk.

'''SYLVIE:''' Oh, yeah?

[''Sylvie throws her sword, severing the head of Time-Keeper 1. The other two Time-Keepers laugh. The severed head falls down the dais, sparks coming from its neck. Sylvie lifts a pruning stick and starts up the dais toward the other two.'']

'''LOKI:''' Wait.

[''There's a powering-down sound and the other two Time-Keepers go limp. Sylvie runs down the dais for the severed head.'']

'''LOKI:''' Don't.

[''Sylvie picks up the head, examining the exposed electronics of an android.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Fake.
Mindless androids.

'''LOKI:''' It never stops.

[''Loki looks around, breathing deeply.'']

'''LOKI:''' Then who created the TVA?

'''SYLVIE:''' I thought this was it.

[''Sylvie throws the head aside. Loki turns away, but something occurs to him, and he turns back.'']

'''LOKI:''' Sylvie...

'''SYLVIE:''' Not another pep talk, please.

'''LOKI:''' No, I have to tell you something.
We will figure this out.

'''SYLVIE:''' How do you know that?

'''LOKI:''' Because, uh...
Well, back on Lamentis...
This is new for me. Um...

'''SYLVIE:''' What?

[''Loki hesitates and touches her shoulders.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' What is it?

[''Loki inhales, about to speak, but a light appears in his chest and spreads - he's pruned, disappearing, revealing Ravonna behind him with the pruning stick. Ravonna lunges for Sylvie, but Sylvie takes the pruning stick and holds it over her.'']

'''RAVONNA:''' Do it.

'''SYLVIE:''' No.
You're gonna tell me everything.

<poem>
If the sun
Should tumble from the sky
If the sea
Should suddenly run dry
If you love me
Really love me
Let it happen
I won't care
If it seems
That everything is lost
I will smile
And never count the cost
If you love me
Really love me
Let it happen
Darling, I
Won't care
Shall I catch a shooting star?
Shall I bring it where you are?
If you want me to, I will
You can set me any task
I'll do anything you ask
If you'll only say you love me still
When at last
Our life on earth is through
I will share
Eternity with you
If you love me
Really love me
Let it happen
I won't care
I you love me
Really love me
Let it happen
Darling, I...

Am I dead?

'''RENSLAYER:''' Trusting this man is not a good idea.

'''MOBIUS:''' I can handle him.
The TVA has pruned a lotta these guys,
and no two are alike.

'''LOKI:''' You're all Variants!
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.
They kidnapped you from the timeline.

'''MOBIUS:''' The nexus event you caused,
whatever that connection is,
can bring this whole place down.

'''RENSLAYER:''' Fine. You want the truth?
I'm trying to protect you.
Friendship like ours is uncommon.

'''MOBIUS:''' You know where I'd go
if I could go anywhere?
Wherever it is I'm really from.
Yeah, wherever I had a life
before the TVA came along.

'''RENSLAYER:''' Prune him.

[''Groans'']

'''SYLVIE:''' The Time-Keepers took your lives from you.
You're Variants.
We're the same.

'''SYLVIE:''' Mindless androids.

'''LOKI:''' Then who created the TVA?
Sylvie, I have to tell you something.

'''SYLVIE:''' You're gonna tell me everything.

== The Void ==
[''Back at the TVA, Chronomonitors continue their work as usual. The chamber of the Time-Keepers is empty, except the ruins of the Time-Keeper androids.'']

[''In The Void, a large purple cloud (Alioth) descends on a ruined land.'']

'''LOKI:''' What is this place?
Where are we? Who are you?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' This is The Void. That's Alioth.
And we're his lunch. Come on!

[''The Lokis all head off with Loki following. Alioth bellows.'']

[''Opening theme'']

== TVA Courtroom ==
'''SYLVIE:''' Give me your TemPad.

[''Renslayer does so.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Who's really behind the TVA?

'''RENSLAYER:''' I'm as in the dark as you are. 

[''Sylvie steps on her shoulder and Renslayer groans.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Poor Judge Renslayer.
Your whole reality's been destroyed.
Tell me, how does it feel
to be on the other side of it?

[''Sylvie lifts her foot and Renslayer groans. Sylvie looks around.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' This is it, isn't it?
This is where you dragged me
after you stole my life.
A fitting place, then, to take yours.

'''RENSLAYER:''' And what if I said Loki wasn't dead?
Not yet, anyway.

'''SYLVIE:''' I'd say you were lying.

'''RENSLAYER:''' Maybe.
Or maybe we want the same thing.

'''SYLVIE:''' How is he still alive?
And how will saving him get us closer
to who's really behind the TVA?

'''RENSLAYER:''' It's complicated.
I'm telling you this willingly.

'''SYLVIE:''' Why?

'''RENSLAYER:''' Because I wanna know
who's at the top of this.
I want to know who lied to me.
When we prune a branched reality,
it's impossible
to destroy all of its matter.
So we move it to a place on the timeline
where it won't continue growing.
Basically, the branched
timeline isn't reset.
It's transferred.

'''SYLVIE:''' To where?

'''RENSLAYER:''' A void at the end of time.
Where every instance of existence
collides at the same point
and simply stops.

'''SYLVIE:''' Why?

'''RENSLAYER:''' I don't know.
The dogma states that the end of time
is still being written,
that the Time-Keepers
are transforming it into utopia.

'''SYLVIE:''' That's nice. Super believable.

'''RENSLAYER:''' Whatever the real reason...
nothing ever comes back from there.
I can help you if you trust me.

[''Sylvie hands the TemPad back to Renslayer.'']

== The Void ==
[''The Lokis walk

'''LOKI:''' I suggest we take a breather,
so I can ask several thousand questions.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Don't die.

'''LOKI:''' Okay, understood, but beyond that?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Don't die.

'''LOKI:''' That's not a plan.
It's a general demand of living.
If you're Lokis, you should always have a plan.

[''Birds come squaking by.'']

'''LOKI:''' Will someone please explain to me
what the hel is going on?
Look, it's been a very, very,
very trying past few days.
Months? I don't even know
how long it's been since New York.
All I know is, I got pruned
and I woke up here,
and now I'm surrounded
by Variants of myself, plus an alligator,
which I'm heartbroken to report I didn't even find
all that strange.
And now we're running from God knows what
trying to get to God knows where.
When I need to be trying to find
a way back to the TVA.

[''Loki's voice has been rising. Alioth rumbles in the distance. Kid Loki pulls a dagger on Loki, who backs up and falls.'']

'''KID LOKI:''' Stop wailing or you will signal Alioth.

'''LOKI:''' You mean the monster in the sky?

[''Kid Loki disappears his dagger and gives Loki a hand up.'']

'''LOKI:''' Thank you.

'''KID LOKI:''' This is the place
where the TVA dumps its rubbish,
everything they prune.
And Alioth,
he ensures none of it ever returns.

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' It's a living tempest
that consumes matter and energy.
They send entire branched realities here
that are devoured in an instant.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' We're in a shark tank.
Alioth is the shark.

[''Alligator Loki growls.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Oh, there's no such thing
as an alligator tank.
Besides, it's a better metaphor.
He's overly sensitive like the rest of us.

'''LOKI:''' Hang on,
you're telling me that thing's a Loki too?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Oh, yes.

'''LOKI:''' Okay, fine. Willing to accept that.
Why are there so many of you?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Because Lokis survive.
That's just what we do.

'''LOKI:''' Great. So how do we escape?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' We don't.
All of us were arrested by the TVA
and pruned, just like you.

And just like you're doing right now, we all stood around
making bad plans that went nowhere.

'''LOKI:''' Yes, but have you thought of using a TemPad?

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' Oh, the one thing
that could easily get us out of here, yes.
They're all over the place, right, guys?

[''The other Lokis all laugh.'']

'''LOKI:''' Fine. What about causing a nexus event?

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' The TVA doesn't care what happens here.

'''LOKI:''' Surely there's something to do.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' There is.
Survive. That's all there is.
All there ever was.

'''KID LOKI:''' We're done talking. Let's go.
Just do what you want, I guess.

[''The other Lokis walk on. Loki looks around. Thunder rumbles. He hurries after them.'']

'''LOKI:''' Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Why do you wear the horns?
You let a child command you.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' You'll do well to respect the boy.
This is his kingdom.

'''LOKI:''' Right.
What was your nexus event, Your Majesty?

'''KID LOKI:''' I killed Thor.

[''They continue on. Classic Loki uses magic to open a hatch into their hidden base. As the camera descends, layers of rubbish is shown through the soil, including Mjolnir and a small frog-Thor trapped in a jar.'']

== Loki's base ==
[''The Loki's descend the ladder into the base.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' So, why did you want to return
to the TVA so badly, anyway?

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' You leave your glorious purpose there?

'''LOKI:''' Something like that.

== TVA Courtroom ==
'''RENSLAYER:''' Miss Minutes,
I need you to remote access
a series of restricted files
from the archives.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Ooh, doggy! On what?

'''RENSLAYER:''' The beginning of time.
The founding of the TVA.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Right away.

'''SYLVIE:''' Wait.
What about the end of time?

'''RENSLAYER:''' It's just a void.

'''SYLVIE:''' What if The Void isn't the end?
What if there's something beyond it?

[''Renslayer nods to Miss Minutes, who pulls up a file.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Hiding in the shadow of apocalypses
obscured me from the TVA
because I couldn't create
a diverging branch there, right?
So if all of this is still being written,
whatever happens is just a new timeline.
It would be impossible
to start a nexus event there.
You could be completely undetectable.

'''RENSLAYER:''' That's it.
That's the only place they could be.

'''SYLVIE:''' So how do we get past The Void?

'''RENSLAYER:''' [''Sighs''] It's impossible.
There's nothing for the TemPad
to lock onto, no destination.

'''SYLVIE:''' Then we go through it.

'''RENSLAYER:''' That's suicide.

'''SYLVIE:''' Then I guess my need for you has passed.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Wait. What about The Void spacecraft?

'''RENSLAYER:''' Yes, the prototype.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Great. I'll get the file.

'''RENSLAYER:''' It's a spaceship designed
to withstand the temporal void.
It could take us to the end of time.

'''SYLVIE:''' Find Loki.

'''RENSLAYER:''' Find the man behind the curtain.

'''SYLVIE:''' And kill him.

'''RENSLAYER:''' Together.

[''Renslayer extends her hand to Sylvie, who takes it and they shake. Sylvie doesn't let go of her hand.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Miss Minutes,
where are the files on this timecraft?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Still lookin', hon.

'''SYLVIE:''' Nothing?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Hmm. Buried pretty deep.

'''RENSLAYER:''' It's highly restricted.
I might not even have clearance.

'''SYLVIE:''' Oh, no, I think you would. If it's real.

'''RENSLAYER:''' How long?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Any second now.

'''GUARD:''' [''From outside''] Go! Go! Go! Move it!

[''The courtroom doors open and guards come in with weapons raised. Miss Minutes winks out. Sylvie shoves Renslayer, grabs the TemPad, and leaps behind the judge's desk.'']

'''GUARD:''' You hurt?

'''RENSLAYER:''' I'm fine, but she took my TemPad.
Sylvie? Not thinking
of going on the run, are you?
We know where you hide.
Sooner or later, we'll catch you.
It must be so exhausting.

'''SYLVIE:''' I'll admit you had me fooled there
for a minute.
Or did you get a little real?
Did Judge Renslayer really feel betrayed
by her beloved TVA?

'''RENSLAYER:''' Why don't you come back out
and we can talk about it?

'''SYLVIE:''' Sure. Just tell everyone else to piss off
and we can settle this between us.

'''RENSLAYER:''' Works for me.

'''SYLVIE:''' What happened to finding
the man behind the curtain?

'''RENSLAYER:''' Tell you what.
You come out with your hands up
and I'll put you in a time loop.
Something not so bad.
You can live out your days
in a good memory.
Do you have any good memories?

[''Sylvie eyes the weapon she still holds.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' [''To herself''] Just one, really.

[''Sylvie places the TemPad in her pocket, stands up, uses the weapon on herself. She disappears.'']

'''GUARD:''' She self-pruned.

'''RENSLAYER:''' Good.
Then she's dead, too.

[''Ravonna walks out.'']

== Loki's base ==
[''Pleasant music plays. Boxed "Roxxiwine" Pinot Noir is on the counter. Classic Loki pours some wine into Alligator Loki's mouth.'']

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' So, after I vanquished
Captain America and Iron Man,
I claimed my prize:
all six Infinity Stones.

[''Alligator Loki growls.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' That's alligator for growling
and saying "liar" at the same time.

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' Well at least my nexus event
wasn't eating the wrong neighbor's cat.

[''Alligator Loki snarls and leaves its mini pool to attack Boastful Loki. He bites his hand. Classic Loki and Loki jump up to separate them.'']

'''LOKI:''' Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hey, hey, hey.

[''Kid Loki sits on a throne and watches them, amused. Classic Loki pulls Alligator Loki off and throws him back in the mini pool.'']

'''KID LOKI:''' Tell them your story, Loki.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Me?
Nobody wants to hear about that.

'''LOKI:''' I, I would, actually.
Um...
It's just I've, I've been wondering,
because I'm...
Well, we're supposed to die, right?
Thanos kills us after Ragnarok.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Thanos?
In my timeline,
everything proceeded correctly,
my entire life,
until Thanos attacked our ship.

'''LOKI:''' So you, you ''didn't'' try to stab him?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' [''Chuckles''] Certainly not.
Oh take no offense, my friends,
but blades are worthless
in the face of a Loki sorcery.
They stunt our magical potential.

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' But they look awesome.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Oh, yes.
Especially when they clatter to the ground
just before your neck is snapped.
I cast a projection of myself so real,
even the Mad Titan believed it.
Then hid as inanimate debris.
After I faked my death,
I simply drifted in space.
Away from Thor, away from everything.
Thought about the universe
and my place in it,
and it occurred to me
that everywhere I went,
only pain followed.
So I removed myself from the equation,
landed on a remote planet
and stayed there in isolation, in solitude
for a long, long time.

'''LOKI:''' How did the TVA find you?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' I got lonely.
[''Chuckles'']
To tell you the truth,
I missed my brother,
and I wondered if he missed me,
if anybody else did.
But as soon as I took
my first steps to getting off the planet,
the TVA arrived.
Because we, my friends,
have but one part to play,
the God of Outcasts.
Nothing more.
The God of Outcasts.

[''The other Lokis all drink to that, including Kid Loki and his Hi-C juice box. Loki shakes his head and stands.'']

'''LOKI:''' I'm going.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Going where?

'''LOKI:''' Out of this place,
out of The Void, back to the TVA.
We may be good at surviving,
but we're also good at escaping.
I'd wager that gives me a decent chance as any.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' You won't do either, you'll be brutally murdered.

'''LOKI:''' Well, so be it.
That was my destiny to begin with.

'''KID LOKI:''' You're different.
Why?

'''LOKI:''' No, I'm not, you see?
I'm the same, really.
I'm the same as all of you.
Have any of you met a woman Variant of us?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Sounds terrifying.

'''LOKI:''' Oh, she is.
But that's kind of what's great about her.
''She's'' different.
She's not trying to take over the TVA,
she's trying to take it down.
And she needs me.
Now, you said Alioth
is what keeps us here.
You said it's a living thing.
You said it's a shark.
Well, if it lives, it dies.
So I'm gonna kill the shark.
I'm gonna kill Alioth,
and I could use all the help I can get.

[''The other Lokis look at each other, then burst out laughing.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Yeah, baby. Yeah.

[''Loki walks away. Laughing continues.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''To himself''] Monsters.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Oh, yeah!

[''Loki ascends the ladder and opens the hatch. He looks up and gasps. About ten Lokis stand above him.'']

'''PRESIDENT LOKI:''' Ah. Hello, which one of us are you?

'''LOKI:''' [''Sighs''] This is a nightmare.

== The Void ==
[''Sylvie wakes in a dilapidated bus. Wind whistles and thunder rumbles. She kicks out the window and gets out. Alioth descends behind her and she runs.''] 

[''A wisp of Alioth gets in front of her, and Sylvie touches it with magic, briefly connecting to see flashes of a mansion.'']

[''She continues running. A car approaches from ahead, horn honking. She jumps into the car.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' You.

[''The car speeds away.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Can you shut the door,
we still got a little bit of a situation here.
By the way, you should be careful just jumping
into a stranger's car like that.

'''SYLVIE:''' Watch out!

'''MOBIUS:''' I see it, I see it.

'''SYLVIE:''' Really? Because you're driving right towards it.

'''MOBIUS:''' God, you really are one of you.
Hang on.

== Loki's base ==
[''President Loki and his army of nine Lokis stand in the Loki base.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' [''To Loki''] You bastard!
You led the wolves to our door.

'''PRESIDENT LOKI:''' We prefer snakes to wolves.

'''KID LOKI:''' I've eaten both. They die just the same.

[''Kid Loki steps forward, but Boastful Loki holds his hammer to Kid Loki.'']

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' Apologies, my liege.
I betrayed you, and now, I'm king.

'''PRESIDENT LOKI:''' About that...

[''The army of Lokis raise their weapons toward Boastful Loki.'']

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' You can't be serious.

'''PRESIDENT LOKI:''' Come on.
What did you expect?

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' That was not the bargain!
I gave you our location.
In exchange for shelter and supplies,
you give me your army
and I take the throne.

'''PRESIDENT LOKI:''' Ah, yes.
Not so good a bargain.
How about this one? My army, my throne?

'''ANOTHER LOKI:''' About that.

[''The army of Lokis turn on President Loki.'']

'''PRESIDENT LOKI:''' Why you beef-witted, half-faced scrubs.
We had a deal!

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' For God's sake.

[''Alligator Loki growls. Loki sighs.'']

'''PRESIDENT LOKI:''' Why the hell
is there an alligator in here?

'''CLASSIC LOKI & KID LOKI:''' He's a Loki!

[''Alligator Loki snarls and lunges at President Loki, clamping on his hand. They struggle, and President Loki pulls him off, but Alligator Loki has bitten off his hand. President Loki screams. Alligator Loki swallows.'']

[''A fight breaks out with all the Lokis fighting each other. Kid Loki picks up Alligator Loki. Loki tries to sneak out while avoiding the fights. Another Loki swings at Loki from behind, but Classic Loki blasts him back.'']

'''BOASTFUL LOKI:''' Glorious purpose!

[''Classic Loki uses magix to create illusions of himself, Loki, Kid Loki, and Alligator Loki as the actual four of them sneak away.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Come on.

[''Classic Loki creates a magic portal that they escape through.'']

'''ANOTHER LOKI:''' Take that, Loki!

== Outside Loki's base ==

[''They emerge outside the base in The Void.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Damn it! Animals, animals!
We lie and we cheat,
we cut the throat of every person
who trusts us, and for what?
Power. Glorious power. Glorious purpose!
We cannot change.
We're broken,
every version of us. Forever.

'''KID LOKI:''' And whenever one of us
dares try to fix themselves,
they're sent here to die.

'''LOKI:''' That's why I need to get out of here.
Nothing can change
until the TVA is stopped.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' And you trust her?

'''LOKI:''' She's the only one I do trust.
And right now, I believe
she's our only chance of stopping the TVA.

'''KID LOKI:''' That's good enough for me.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Okay. Okay, we'll help you.
But approaching Alioth
is a death sentence.
We'll get you to it,
but that's as far as we go.

[''Loki nods.'']

== Driving ==

'''MOBIUS:''' All that time, I really believed
we were the good guys.

'''SYLVIE:''' Annihilating entire realities,
orphaning little girls,
classic hero stuff.

'''MOBIUS:''' Well, I guess when you think
the ends justify the means,
there's not much you won't do.
By the way, you did some annihilating too.

'''SYLVIE:''' I did what I had to do.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah, so did I.

'''SYLVIE:''' You hunted me like a dog.

'''MOBIUS:''' I'm sorry about that.

'''SYLVIE:''' When I pruned myself,
I thought I might be able to find Loki.
That storm, that thing,
it's likely already got him.

'''MOBIUS:''' You really believe that?

'''SYLVIE:''' It doesn't matter.
The only thing that matters now
is getting out of here
and finding out who's behind all of this.

'''MOBIUS:''' Great. How do we do that?

'''SYLVIE:''' We turn around.

'''MOBIUS:''' Turn around?
What, and go back to the angry cloud?

'''SYLVIE:''' Yeah. I think it might be the answer.
We're going back to it.

[''Mobius turns the car around.'']

== Walking ==
[''The four Lokis walking, with Kid Loki holding a tracking device.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' I have to say, it feels odd
walking toward the gargantuan creature.
Do you have a plan of action?

'''LOKI:''' Get inside, find its heart
or brain or whatever,
and then, you know, do it in.

'''KID LOKI:''' I mean...

'''LOKI:''' Okay just because it's not complicated
doesn't mean it's bad.

'''KID LOKI:''' It also doesn't mean it's good.

[''Alligator Loki growls.'']

'''LOKI:''' See? He's on board.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' He's praying.
He thinks we're going to die.

[''Kid Loki's device beeps. They stand on a hill and watch a pruned reality arrive: the USS Eldridge military ship. The crew clamors on the deck.'']

'''SAILOR:''' All hands to battle stations!

'''LOKI:''' Alioth is like any animal.
He'll go after the big meal first.
And while he's busy with that,
we can sneak around the back and...

[''Alioth bellows as it approaches the USS Eldridge. Sailors clamor.'']

'''SAILOR:''' Fire!

[''The ship fires into Alioth. The purple cloud envelopes the screaming crew. Alioth recedes, leaving a dilapidated ship and no survivors.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''Panting''] Okay.
Maybe we, uh...
think a bit more about this, huh?

[''Kid Loki glances at his device and turns around.'']

'''KID LOKI:''' Car.

[''The others turn toward it.'']

'''LOKI:''' What?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Along the horizon.

'''LOKI:''' Is that bad?

'''KID LOKI:''' Well, usually means
cannibalistic marauders
or cannibalistic pirates.

'''LOKI:''' Delightful.
Now they're slowing down.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' What are they doing?

'''KID LOKI:''' Just stay on guard.

[''The car stops. Sylvie gets out.'']

'''LOKI:''' Sylvie.

[''Loki runs toward her.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' I don't understand.
Is he a coward or was he being brave?

'''KID LOKI:''' I'm not too sure.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Come on.

'''SYLVIE:''' You're alive.

'''LOKI:''' What happened? You okay?

[''Mobius gets out and joins them.'']

'''LOKI:''' Mobius!
How did you...

'''SYLVIE:''' We thought you could do with some backup.

[''Classic Loki, Kid Loki, and Alligator Loki walk over. Sylvie turns like she's ready to fight.'']

'''LOKI:''' Oh, no, wait, wait, wait,
these are my friends.
Well, they're, um... How best to put this?
Us as a child, us in the future,
and us as an alligator.
It's best not to question it.

'''MOBIUS:''' You throw a rock out here, you hit a Loki.

'''SYLVIE:''' So you're all after
the giant cloud monster, too, then?

'''LOKI:''' Well, we haven't decided
how we're going to kill it, but...

'''SYLVIE:''' Sorry, come again? Kill it?

'''LOKI:''' Yes, we're gonna kill Alioth.

'''SYLVIE:''' Oh, my God. That was your plan.

'''LOKI:''' Yeah.

'''SYLVIE:''' And you all went along with it?

'''KID LOKI:''' I had my doubts.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Probably unsafe.

'''LOKI:''' All right, well, what's your plan, then?

'''SYLVIE:''' I think the person we're after
is beyond The Void at the end of time.
And if they are,
that thing is just their guard dog
protecting the only way in.

'''LOKI:''' Okay, so, um, how do we get past
the guard dog?

'''SYLVIE:''' I'm gonna enchant it.

'''LOKI:''' [''Laughs'']
That's insane, right?

'''SYLVIE:''' As insane as what?
Paper-cutting a giant cloud to death?

'''LOKI:''' Listen,
I've been down here longer than you,
I know a thing or two...

'''SYLVIE:''' I'm going to enchant it.

'''MOBIUS:''' She's pretty confident.

== Time Theater 38 ==
[''Renslayer enters. There are two guards at the door.'']

'''RENSLAYER:''' Leave us.

[''The guards leave. Renslayer opens a panel, where Hunter B-15 is being held.'']

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Why am I locked in here?

'''RENSLAYER:''' You freed the Variant.
You were disloyal to the TVA.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Disloyal?

'''RENSLAYER:''' Did you think you'd escape punishment for that?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Disloyal to who?
You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers.
They weren't real.

'''RENSLAYER:''' And why does that changes anything?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' That changes everything!
The people need to know the truth.

'''RENSLAYER:''' No, the TVA needs stability.
And until we can figure out what's going on,
that is what it will get.
So you need to tell me everything.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' What exactly do you want from me?

'''RENSLAYER:''' You had a link with the Variant.
I want you to tell me what drives her.

'''HUNTER B-15:''' Revenge drives her.
Killing the Time-Keepers.
But they turned out to be fake,
in case you forgot.
So she'll be searching
for whomever created them.
[''Scoffs.'']
This isn't about protecting
the TVA at all, is it?
You just want to find
whoever is behind all of this, too.
[''Chuckles'']
You'll never find them.
Not before she does.

'''RENSLAYER:''' And why is that?

'''HUNTER B-15:''' You only want it.
She needs it.

== TVA hallway ==
[''Renslayer leaves the Time Theater and pulls out her TemPad. Miss Minutes jumps into view.'']

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Hey, y'all.

'''RENSLAYER:''' I need all the files
on the founding of the TVA.
Everything from the beginning of time.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Well, that's a mighty tall order.

'''RENSLAYER:''' Whoever created this place is in danger.
I need to find them.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Okay. Right away, ma'am.

== The Void ==
[''In a dilapidated building, something is roasting over a fire. Alligator Loki, Mobius, Classic Loki, and Kid Loki sit around talking.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:'''
You really don't remember him?

'''MOBIUS:''' I mean,
the TVA arrested a lot of Lokis,
but, no, I don't remember an alligator.
I mean, who's to say
he's even a Loki Variant?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' He is green, isn't he?

'''MOBIUS:''' I don't know, he could be lying.
The long con. Of course, that just
makes him ''more'' likely to be a Loki.
It's always the game within the game
with you guys, which I respect.

'''KID LOKI:''' Mobius,
assuming you do get back to the TVA,
what exactly are you
getting yourself into?

'''MOBIUS:''' I don't know.
I'd like to let people know the truth.

So just like that,
you're turning on the very thing
you devoted your life to.

'''MOBIUS:''' Well, it's never too late to change.

'''KID LOKI:''' I hope they know what they're doing.

[''Outside, Loki and Sylvie sit in a meadow of overgrown grass.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Mobius isn't so bad.

'''LOKI:''' Or so good.
I think that's why we get along.

'''SYLVIE:''' He cares about you.

'''LOKI:''' It's cold.

'''SYLVIE:''' Mmm-hmm.

[''Loki conjures a blanket around himself.'']

'''LOKI:''' I could conjure one for you, if you like.

'''SYLVIE:''' Tell you what, you could conjure me a new outfit.
You have no idea how uncomfortable
something like this is.
[''Pause.'']
So...
Mobius and his, um... theory about...

'''LOKI:''' Oh right, right. About our nexus event.

'''SYLVIE:''' Total rubbish, right?

'''LOKI:''' Absolutely. Of course. I mean...

'''SYLVIE:''' I don't mean that it wasn't, you know, a nice moment.

'''LOKI:''' No, it was great. It was really nice. It was, it was great.

'''SYLVIE:''' It just sounds like another TVA lie.

'''LOKI:''' A hundred percent.
I mean, totally. Yeah.

[''Another pause.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' I don't know how to do this.

'''LOKI:''' I don't even know what we're doing.

'''SYLVIE:''' I don't have friends.
I don't have...
anyone.

'''LOKI:''' Well...
there are more important things, right?

'''SYLVIE:''' Right? Yeah.
Like, like bringing down the TVA.

'''LOKI:''' I mean, saving the universe, even.

'''SYLVIE:''' Well, there's no need to be dramatic,
but, yeah, kind of.

[''Loki uses magic to extend his blanket to also wrap around Sylvie.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' It's not very snuggly.

'''LOKI:''' [''Chuckling''] Okay.

'''SYLVIE:''' Is it a tablecloth?

'''LOKI:''' No, it's a blanket.

'''SYLVIE:''' Thank you.

'''LOKI:''' My pleasure.

[''Pause.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' How do I know that, in the final moments,
you won't betray me?

'''LOKI:''' Listen, Sylvie, I...
[''Sighs deeply.'']
I betrayed everyone who ever loved me.
I betrayed my father, my brother...
my home.
I know what I did.
And I know why I did it.
And that's not who I am anymore.
Okay?
I won't let you down.

'''SYLVIE:''' You sure?
'Cause if we make it, and the TVA is gone,
there might be a timeline for you to rule.

'''LOKI:''' Ah.
And then I'd finally be happy.

[''They smile at each other. Loki leans over to nudge her shoulder with his.'']

'''LOKI:''' What about you?
What will you do when this is all over?

'''SYLVIE:''' I don't know.

'''LOKI:''' I don't know either.
Maybe...
Maybe we could figure it out...
together.

'''SYLVIE:''' Maybe.

== The Attack ==
[''Birds go squawking around. Thunder rumbles. The Lokis, Sylvie, and Mobius stand on a hill looking at Alioth.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Okay, so what's the next move?

'''SYLVIE:''' The TVA needs to be brought down.
We don't know who created it
or where they are,
but that thing out there does.
When it hit me earlier, I linked to it.
It was brief,
but I caught a glimpse of something,
and I think if I can get
close enough to it, I can enchant it,
and it's gonna take me
to whoever's behind all of this.

[''Sylvie hands Loki the TemPad.'']

'''LOKI:''' I'm staying.

'''SYLVIE:''' Loki, I don't even know if this is gonna work.

'''LOKI:''' You go, I go.

[''Loki hands the TemPad to Mobius. Kid Loki's device beeps.'']

'''KID LOKI:''' It's happening, guys.
The branch will be right out there.

'''MOBIUS:''' I'll give your regards
to Renslayer.

'''SYLVIE:''' Oh, please do.

'''MOBIUS:''' You boys want a ticket out of here?

'''KID LOKI:''' What? No. We're staying here.

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' This is our home.

[''Alligator Loki growls.'']

'''LOKI:''' Are you sure? What about Alioth?

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' We've survived this long.
We know what we're doing.

'''KID LOKI:''' Loki, you're gonna need this
on your journey.
Go on.

[''Kid Loki conjures his dagger and hands it to Loki. Loki accepts it. He conjures a sheath and sheathes the blade.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Good luck.
I hope you find what you're looking for.

[''Classic Loki, Kid Loki, and Alligator Loki leave. Mobius opens a Timedoor.'']

'''MOBIUS:''' Looks like you got away in the end.

'''LOKI:''' I always do.
What will you do at the TVA?

'''MOBIUS:''' Burn it to the ground.
Thanks for the spark.
Well, see you later, Loki.

[''Mobius offers a hand to Loki. Loki steps forward and they hug instead.'']

'''LOKI:''' Thank you, my friend.

'''MOBIUS:''' [''Whispers to Sylvie''] You're my favorite.

[''Mobius leaves through the Timedoor. Loki and Sylvie head toward Alioth.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' When a branch appears,
Alioth will focus on it.
That's when I'll enchant it.

[''As Classic Loki walks away, he looks back, but continues on.'']

[''Alioth roars.'']

'''LOKI:''' What if we don't have time
to wait for a branch?

'''SYLVIE:''' We'll have to cause a distraction.

[''Loki places a hand on her shoulder. She looks at him and shakes her head. He nods. Loki runs, causing a distraction. Sylvie activates her powers. Loki pulls his dagger, ignites it in flame, and waves it.'']

'''LOKI:''' Come and get me!

[''Allioth heads for Loki. Sylvie tries to connect with Alioth, but it turns toward her. Loki runs back.'']

'''LOKI:''' [''Shouting''] No! This way!
Come and get me!

[''Alioth roars as it approaches Sylvie.'']

'''LOKI:''' No! No!

[''A bright green light shines in the distance, and Alioth looks toward it. The illusion of Asgard rises, created by Classic Loki, and Alioth heads toward it.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' How is he doing that?

'''LOKI:''' I think we're stronger than we realize.

[''Classic Loki grunts with the strain of raising the illusion.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Go!

[''His voice echoes back to Loki and Sylvie. Sylvie takes Loki's hand.'']

'''LOKI:''' What are you doing?

'''SYLVIE:''' We're gonna enchant it.

'''LOKI:''' I don't know how.

'''SYLVIE:''' You do.
Because we're the same!

[''Alioth roars and tries to destroy the illusion of Asgard. Loki and Sylvie grasp at tendrils of Alioth, trying to enchant it.'']

[''The illusion of Asgard begins to collapse.'']

[''Sylvie tightens her grip on Loki's hand. Loki's magic shines.'']

[''Classic Loki collapses and the illusion completely recedes. Alioth heads for Classic Loki, who stands and raises magic in his hands.'']

'''CLASSIC LOKI:''' Glorious purpose!

[''Classic Loki laughs. Alioth sweeps over him, leaving behind a tarnished horned helmet.'']

[''Alioth turns back toward Sylvie and Loki. Loki closes his eyes. Green magic flares from him and Sylvie up to Alioth, turning the purple green.'']

'''SYLVIE:''' Open your eyes.

[''Loki does so and sighs. The clouds of Alioth part, revealing a mansion beyond. Still holding hands, Loki and Sylvie walk toward it.'']

[''End credits.'']

== Previously on ==
[This previously on showcases the important moments of past episodes]

MOBIUS: You weren't born to be king, Loki.
You were born to cause pain
and suffering and death.

[PREVIOUSLY ON]

RAVONNA RENSLAYER: The Time-Keepers are all
that stand between us
and full-scale calamity.

MOBIUS: For all time.

RENSLAYER: Always.

HUNTER B-15 : Why am I locked in here?

RENSLAYER: You were disloyal to the TVA.

HUNTER B-15: You were in the Time-Keepers'
chambers. They weren't real!

RENSLAYER: And why does that change anything?

HUNTER B-15: That changes everything!

MOBIUS: The nexus event
the two of you caused,
whatever that connection is,
can bring this whole place down!

LOKI: This is new for me. Back on Lamentis...

RENSLAYER: I can help you if you trust me.

SYLVIE: The person we're after
is beyond The Void at the end of time.

That thing is just their guard dog
protecting the only way in.

LOKI: How do we get past the guard dog?

SYLVIE: I'm gonna enchant it.

MOBIUS: She's pretty confident.

CLASSIC LOKI: Go!

== Opening ==
[''Voices overlapping the Marvel Studios logo. The voices can be heard when their character appears on screen''] 

SAM WILSON/FALCON: Way to go, Tic Tac!

HOPE VAN DYNE/WASP: That's how you punch.

T'CHALLA/BLACK PANTHER: Wakanda forever!

SCOTT LANG/ANT-MAN: You haven't heard of me.

NATASHA ROMANOFF/BLACK WIDOW: Let me put you on hold.

PETER QUILL/STAR-LORD: Dance-off, bro.

THOR: He's a friend from work!

STEVE ROGERS/CAPTAIN AMERICA: I can do this all day.

Yeah, I know.

HANK PYM: I'll show you ferocity.

CAPTAIN MARVEL:
Higher, further, faster, baby.

LOKI: We have a Hulk.

KORG: We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?

(INDISTINCT OVERLAPPING CHATTER.)

[''Voices overlapping images of the universe. It first zooms out to show the sun, and then deep space with satellites. It then goes through a supernova and out of a black hole. It goes into another black hole. After that, it goes through the universe hyperspeed, and then goes into a tunnel. The camera pans out and reveals a ring of light going around the citadel at the end of time.'']

MAN: We think of time
as a one-way motion.

NEIL ARMSTRONG:
One small step for man...

GRETA THUNBERG: How dare they!

MALALA YOUSAFZAI: My dream...

NELSON MANDELA: We have fought
for the right to experience peace.

CLASSIC LOKI: Glorious purpose!

WOMAN: Motivated by women
throughout the world.

VISION: What is grief,
if not love persevering?

MAYA ANGELOU: I will rise.

SYLVIE: Open your eyes! 

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

== Citadel at the End of Time ==
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

[''Loki and Sylvie are standing in front of the citadel.]''

Aren't you gonna tell me
not to kick the door in?

It never made a difference.

Well, if you think it's a bad idea,
I prefer you to speak your mind.

No. Nothing to say.

That'll be a first.

(CLEARS THROAT)

(SIGHS)

'''LOKI:''' Everything okay?

'''SYLVIE:''' (SNIFFLES) Yeah. Just need a moment.

'''LOKI:''' Right.
It's just, you normally...

'''SYLVIE:''' 
Loki, shut up.
I was pruned before you even existed.
I have been waiting for this moment
my entire life.
I just need a second
to get my head straight, okay?

'''LOKI:''' Sure. Of course.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Hey, y'all.

'''SYLVIE:''' You again?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Welcome to The Citadel at the End of Time.

Come on.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Congratulations.
Y'all had an awfully long journey
to get here.
He's impressed.

Who's impressed?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' He Who Remains.

And who is he?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' He created all and he controls all.
At the end, it is only He Who Remains.
And he wants to offer you a deal.
He's been making
a few creative adjustments,
and he's worked it out so we can reinsert
both of y'all back into the Timeline
in a way that won't disrupt things.

"Won't disrupt things"?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Mmm-hmm.
The TVA can keep doin' its vital work
and y'all can live the lives
you've always wanted.

And what have we always wanted?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Now,
don't play coy with me, mister.
You know how you got into this mess.

What?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' 
The Battle of New York, silly.
You versus those self-righteous Avengers.
How would you like to win?
But not just there.
You can kill Thanos.
You want the Infinity Gauntlet? Yours.
Throne of Asgard? No problem.
What about you, missy?
All those years on the run.
Desperate, alone.
How would you like to wake up tomorrow
with just a lifetime of happy memories?

Two Lokis in the same place.

Both of us...
together on the Timeline.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' It's crazy, but he could make it work.
All of it.
Everything.
Exactly the way you've always wanted.
And you can have it all, together.

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

'''SYLVIE:''' It's fiction.
We write our own destiny now.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Oh, sure you do. Good luck with that.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Come on.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Hey, there.

What took you so long?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Sorry.
Some things had to get worked out,
but I'm downloadin'
the files you need now.

This isn't what I asked for.

'''MISS MINUTES:''' I know, but he thinks
this'll be more useful.

Who?

'''MISS MINUTES:''' Happy readin'.

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

LOKI: He Who Remains.

SYLVIE: Not for much longer.

Are we sure he's even still alive?

(DOOR OPENING)

(LOKI BREATHES SHAKILY)

This is wild. (CHUCKLES)
The two of you... (CHUCKLES)
...same person.
I mean, it's a little unnatural. But...
Wow!
Wild.

(CHOMPS)

He Who Remains.

(CHEWING) He Who Remains.
She still calls me that?
Creepy, right? But...
I like it.
Come on. Come on, let's talk in my office.
Not what you were expecting, hmm?

(LOKI BREATHING HEAVILY)

You're just... a man.

Mmm.

Flesh and blood.

(SNIFFLES)

Don't tell me I'm a disappointment.

No.

Just a little bit easier to kill.

(GRUNTS)

(HE WHO REMAINS CHUCKLING)

(SYLVIE GRUNTING)

(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

(DOOR OPENING)

Come on in.

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' One...
Two.
Please, take a seat.
Uh, Loki.
Loki.
Two sugars.

(CLEARS THROAT)

(CHUCKLES)

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

== Judge Renslayer's office ==
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

I said I wasn't to be disturbed.

'''MOBIUS:''' Well, then you're not gonna
be happy to see me.
(WHISPERING) He's back.

If anyone was ever gonna
make it back from The Void,
I suppose it was gonna be you.

'''MOBIUS:''' Oh, well, you know, one man's Void
is another man's piece of cake.

(INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY)

So, you're gonna prune me?

'''MOBIUS:''' I like that idea.
But, you know, my standards might be a
little bit higher in that area than yours.
You know, with close personal friends.

I'm sorry, Mobius.
I couldn't let you get in the way
of our mission.

'''MOBIUS:''' Mission?
The Time-Keepers are fake.
We're all Variants. What mission?

It can't have been for nothing.
That's why I had to prune you.
Hunter D-90 to my office, immediately.

'''MOBIUS:''' Yeah. Sorry, Ravonna. That's not gonna
work out the way you think it is,
now that we know your secret.

What did you do?

== 2018 ==
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

HUNTER U-92: Stay alert, she's close.

Secure the perimeter. I've got her.

Stand down, B-15.

You need to listen to me.

HUNTER U-92: There'll be time for that.

Just wait.

What the hell is going on here?

Judge Renslayer.

What?

Who are you? And what the hell
are you doing in my school?

That isn't Judge Renslayer. (SIGHS)

How?

We have a lot to talk about.

== Citadel at the End of Time ==
'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' 
Been a long journey for you, hasn't it?
Lot of running, lot of pain.
And you... (SPUTTERS)
You're a flea on the back
of a dragon. (CHUCKLES)
In for one hell of a ride.
But you did manage to hang on.

Mmm-hmm. I guess
that counts for something.

I'm not sure you quite understand
the situation.

You've lost.

We found you.

Duh. Of course you did.

(SYLVIE GRUNTS)

Whoa!

A swing and a miss.

(SYLVIE GROWLS)

(LAUGHS)

So, we're still doing that, hmm?

Let's get all this out of the way.

Okay.

Here we go.

You can't kill me because

I already know what's going to happen.

See?

It's a parlor trick.

Okay.

Don't you wonder how I'm able to get out
of the way just before you kill me?

No. It's because of that little TemPad
you have there.

HE WHO REMAINS: Right.

But how do I already have it loaded up
with everything I need to know
to keep from being killed by you two?

It's easy.

I know it all.

And I've seen it all.

Everything you guys
did on Lamentis, I saw.

All the stuff the TVA
didn't know about, I knew.

All the scheming, all the...
(TUTS) ...talking.
That little look by the lake.
Quite sentimental, very touching stuff,
by the way.

No.
No, we broke out of your little game.
That's how we got here.

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' No, wrong.
Every step you took to get here,
Lamentis, The Void,
I paved the road.
You...
You just walked down it.
And I have the rest,
uh, right here.
Everything that's, uh...
that's going to happen.
There's only one way this can go.

Then why are we here?

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Oh, come on.
You know you can't get to the end
until you've been changed by the journey.
This stuff, it needs to happen.
To get us all in the right mindset
to finish the quest.

Right.

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Right.

So, it's all a game.
It's all... a manipulation.

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Interesting, that your head
would go to that.
Sylvie,
you think you can trust this guy?

'''LOKI:''' Don't listen to him.

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' "Don't listen to him." (LAUGHS)
Do you think you're even capable
of trusting anyone at all?

== Judge Renslayer's office ==
'''MOBIUS:''' I think people are ready
to hear a little truth now.
You know, like the TVA is a lie.

But what if it's a necessary one?
Someone created the Time-Keepers.
They created this whole place.
They gave us all purpose.
I have to believe they had a reason.

'''MOBIUS:''' No, because I've seen the horror
waiting for people when they get pruned
and there's nothing necessary
about that.

You know what would happen
if we didn't prune the Timeline?

'''MOBIUS:''' What?

Chaos. Death.

'''MOBIUS:''' Free will?

(SCOFFS) Free will?
Only one person gets free will.
The one in charge.

"Friends across time, allies to the end."

Shut up.

'''MOBIUS:''' That was so beautiful.
And then you sent me to die.
What happened to you?

Nothing, Mobius. I didn't change.

'''MOBIUS:''' You didn't change? You betrayed me.

No, no. You betrayed me!
I looked out for you,
hung my neck out for you,
and you suffer a crisis of faith
and turn to those Variants?
Eons of friendship.
And you threw it all away
on a couple of Lokis.
No, Mobius. I didn't betray you.

'''MOBIUS:''' We can't take away people's free will,
Ravonna. Do you not see that?
What are you doing?

What I need to do.

'''MOBIUS:''' Wait, stop.
Look, maybe we can build this
into something better together.

(SCOFFS) I'm sorry, Mobius.

'''MOBIUS:''' I'm not gonna let you go.

'''RENSLAYER:''' Please, Mobius.
Even with that...
you're of no danger to me.

'''MOBIUS:''' Is that what you think?
Let's see.

(MOBIUS GRUNTS AND GROANS)

'''MOBIUS:''' Yep, you were right. (GROANS)
Back here again.

(GRUNTS)

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

'''MOBIUS:''' Go ahead.

(SIGHS)

'''MOBIUS:''' Where are you gonna go?

In search of free will.

(SIGHS)

== Citadel at the End of Time ==
'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' I understand your moral objections
to what the TVA does.
And my methods are deceptive.
But the mission, it never was.
Without the me, without the TVA...
everything burns.

Then what are you so afraid of?

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Me.

And just who are you?

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Oh, I've been dubbed many names
by many people.
A ruler, a conqueror.
(SNICKERS)
He Who Remains, a jerk.
But it's... it's not as simple as a name.
Eons ago, before the TVA,
a variant of myself lived on Earth
in the 31st century.
He was a scientist
and he discovered that there were
universes stacked on top of his own.
At the same time, other versions of us
were learning the same thing.
Naturally, they made contact.
And for a while, there was peace.
Narcissistic, self-congratulatory peace.
"I love your shoes." "I love your hair."
"Oh, man, nice nose." "Thanks, man."
Et cetera.
They shared technology and knowledge.
Using the best of their universes
to improve the others.
However...
not every version of me
was so... so pure of heart.
To some of us,
new worlds meant only one thing,
new lands to be conquered.
The peace between realities...
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)
...erupted into all-out war,
each variant fighting to preserve
their universe
and annihilate the others.
This was almost the end... (CHUCKLES)
...ladies and gentlemen,
of everything and everyone.

And then the Time-Keepers
came along and saved us all.

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' (SINGING) Amen
No. (CHUCKLES) No.
Nope, this is where we diverge
from the dogma.
That first variant encountered a creature
created from all the tears in reality,
capable of consuming time
and space itself.
A creature...
you both know.

'''LOKI:''' Alioth.

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Bingo!
I harnessed the beast's power
and began experimenting on it.
I weaponized Alioth
and I ended...
I ended the Multiversal War.
Once I isolated our timeline,
all I had to do
was manage the flow of time
and prevent any further branches.
Hence, the TVA.
Hence, the Time-Keepers
and a highly efficient bureaucracy.
Hence, ages... (GRUNTS)
...and ages of cosmic harmony.
Hence...
you're welcome.
You came to kill the devil, right?
(CHUCKLES)
Well, guess what?
I keep you safe.
And if you think I'm evil, well,
just wait till you meet my variants.

And that's the gambit.

Stifling order or cataclysmic chaos.
(CHUCKLES)

'''HE WHO REMAINS:'''
You may hate the dictator,
but something... (EXHALES DEEPLY)
...far worse is gonna fill that void
if you depose of him.
I've lived a million lifetimes.
I've gone through every scenario.
This is the only way.
The TVA,
it works.

Or you're a liar.

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Or I'm a liar.

So you just...
continue to prune innocent timelines?

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Mmm-mmm.
You two would.
There's two options! One...
you kill me and destroy all this,
so you don't just have one devil,
you have an infinite amount. Or...
you two.
You two run the thing.

You're lying.
Why would you give up being in control?

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' (SIGHS)
Buddy...
I'm tired.
And I'm older.
I'm older than I look.
This game is for the young, the hungry.
I've gone through a lot of scenarios...
trying to find the right person
to take this spot.
It turns out that person came in two.
(EXHALES)
But it's definitely you two.
So, no more lies.
You kill me and the Sacred Timeline
is completely exposed.
Multiversal War.
Or you take over and return to the TVA
as its benevolent rulers.
Tell the workforce who they are
and why they do what they do.

You treated real people's lives
like some kind of game.

It's not personal, it's practical.

'''SYLVIE:''' It was personal to me.

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' 
(GROANS) Grow up! Grow up, Sylvie!
Murderer! Hypocrite!
We're all villains here. (CHUCKLES)
We've all done horrible,
terrible, horrific things.
But now, we, you...
have a chance to do them
for a good reason.

(DISTANT RUMBLING)

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' 
We just crossed...
the threshold.
(CHUCKLES)

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Oh.
So, I fibbed.
I fibbed earlier when I said
I know how everything's going to go. I...
I know... I knew... (CHUCKLES)
...everything up to a certain point,
and that point was about...
seven, eight, nine, ten seconds ago.
But now I have no idea.
No idea how the rest of this
is going to go.
I'm being candid.

(HE WHO REMAINS EXHALES DEEPLY)

So, that's it?

That's it?

This is what happens at the end of time?

And now you're just gonna sit there
with all that freedom and...
let us decide your fate?

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Yes!
Yes! Yes! What's the worst
that can happen?
You either...
take over and my life's work continues
or you plunge a blade in my chest
and an infinite amount of me...
start another Multiversal War.
And I just...
end up right back here anyways. (CHUCKLES)
Reincarnation, baby.

No, it's just another lie.

Another manipulation.

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' Oh.
No lie.
No manipulation.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

'''HE WHO REMAINS:''' 
(HE WHO REMAINS SIGHS)
Wow.
(CHUCKLES)
I love this.
I love... all this honesty.
Feels like a fresh start.

Oh, holy...

(LOKI GRUNTS)

'''SYLVIE:''' What're you doing?

'''LOKI:''' Hang on a moment.
Let's just talk about it.

'''SYLVIE:''' Well, how about we finish what we started
and kill him?

(GRUNTS)

(BOTH GRUNTING)

'''LOKI:''' What if he's telling the truth?

So what?

'''LOKI:''' I believe him.

'''SYLVIE:''' Believe what?
That a bazillion boogeymen
will turn up
just because we give people free will?
He's a liar, Loki.

'''LOKI:''' So am I. (PANTING)
And I don't think he was lying.
Not about that.
Insane? Yes.
But maybe he was telling the truth.

Better hurry.
Timeline's already branching.

So, what are you suggesting?

'''LOKI:''' That we think about it.

'''SYLVIE:''' And what precisely
is there to think about?

'''LOKI:''' Weren't you listening
to what he was saying?
That's the gambit.
Remove the dictator
and what fills the void?

'''SYLVIE:''' Ah.
You want the throne?

'''LOKI:''' No, that's not it. No.

'''SYLVIE:''' I don't believe you.

'''LOKI:''' Sylvie, the universe is in the balance,
everything we know to be true. Everything.
I know the TVA has hurt us both.
But what if by taking him out,
we risk unleashing something even worse?
All I'm suggesting is we just
take a minute to think about it.
I promise you from my heart
this isn't about a throne.

'''SYLVIE:''' What was I thinking trusting you?
Has this whole thing been a con?

'''LOKI:''' Really?
That's what you think of me...
after all this time?

Sure. Why not?

Evil Loki's master plan comes together.

Well, you never trusted me, did you?
What was the point?

'''LOKI:''' Can't you see?
This is bigger than our experience.

'''SYLVIE:''' Why aren't we seeing this the same way?

'''LOKI:''' Because you can't trust...
and I can't be trusted.

Then I guess we're in a pickle.

'''LOKI:''' Sylvie, wait.

(PANTING)

Wait.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

'''LOKI:''' Sylvie. Sylvie.

(SYLVIE GRUNTS)

'''LOKI:''' Maybe he's lying! Maybe he's not.
The cost of getting this wrong
is too great.

Fine. Do it.
Kill me. Take your throne.

'''LOKI:''' No.

(SYLVIE GRUNTING)

(GRUNTS)

'''LOKI:''' Sylvie, stop. Stop.

(SWORD CLANKS)

(BOTH PANTING)

'''LOKI:''' Stop.

(SYLVIE BREATHING HEAVILY)

'''LOKI:''' Stop.

(SYLVIE SNIFFLES)

'''LOKI:''' I've been where you are.
I've felt what you feel.
Don't ask me how I know.
All I know...
is I don't wanna hurt you.
I don't want a throne.
I just...
(SIGHS)
I just want you to be okay.

(SYLVIE SNIFFLING)

But I'm not you.

'''MOBIUS:''' No turning back now.

Who said anything about turning back?

"For all time."

"Always."

(SIGHS)

MAN: Copy. Reporting to the armory, sir.

That's, what, 63 new branches
in this unit alone?

Does he want us
to just let them all branch?

At this point, how are we gonna stop it?

'''LOKI:''' We can't!

What?

What'd you say?

'''LOKI:''' It's done, Mobius.
We made a terrible mistake.

What's done?

(MOUTHING) What?

'''LOKI:''' We freed the Timeline.
We found him beyond the storm.
A Citadel at the End of Time.
He's terrifying. He planned everything.
He's seen everything. He knows everything.
It's complicated. Okay?

Right.

'''LOKI:''' But someone is coming.
Countless different versions
of a very dangerous person.
And they're all set on war.
We need to prepare.

Take it easy.
You're an analyst, right?
What division are you from?

'''LOKI:''' What?
What are you talking about?

'''MOBIUS:''' Who are you? What's your name?

Boots on the ground now. Archives.

Who are you?
